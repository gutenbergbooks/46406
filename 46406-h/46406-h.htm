<h2>PAUL JONES.</h2>


<p>American history presents no more picturesque
figure than Paul Jones, and the mere recital of
his life and its incidents is a thrilling romance.
A gardener's boy, he shipped before the mast at
twelve years of age, and afterward rose to be
the ranking officer in the American navy. His
exploits by land and sea in various parts of the
world; his intimacy with some of the greatest
men of the age, and his friendships with reigning
sovereigns of Europe; his character, of deep sentiment,
united with extraordinary genius and extreme
daring,&mdash;place him among those historical
personages who are always of enchanting interest
to succeeding ages. Paul Jones himself foresaw
and gloried in this posthumous fame, for, with
all his great qualities, he had the natural vanity
which so often accompanies the self-made man.
He lacked the perfect self-poise of Washington,
who, having done immortal things, blushed to
have them spoken of, and did not deign to appeal
to posterity. Paul Jones was continually appealing
to posterity. But his vanity was that of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>honest man, and he was often stung to assertiveness
by the malignities of his enemies. That
these malignities were false, and that he was a man
of lofty ideals and admirable character, is shown
by the friends he made and kept. Dr. Franklin,
Thomas Jefferson, Robert Morris, and Lafayette
lived upon terms of the greatest intimacy with
him; Washington esteemed him,&mdash;and the goodwill
of such men places any man in the category
of the upright.</p>

<p>Nothing in the family and circumstances of
Paul Jones indicated the distinction of his later
life. His father, John Paul, was a gardener, at
Arbigland, in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, where
Paul Jones was born in 1747. He was named
John Paul, for his father; but upon his taking up
his residence in Virginia, in his twenty-seventh
year, he added Jones to his name,&mdash;for some reason
which is not now and never has been understood,&mdash;and
as Paul Jones he is known to history.
The Pauls were very humble people, and Paul
Jones's childhood was like the childhood of other
poor men's sons. Boats were his favorite and
only playthings, and he showed from the beginning
that he had the spirit of command. He
organized his playfellows into companies of make-believe
sailors, which he drilled sternly. The
tide rushes into the Solway Firth from the German
ocean so tremendously that it often seems
like a tidal wave, and the boy Paul Jones had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>sometimes to run for his life when he was wading
out commanding his miniature ships and crews.
Close by his father's cottage is the sheltered bay
of the Carsethorn, where, in the old days, ships
for Dumfries loaded and unloaded. Deep water
is so close to the shore that as the ships worked
in and out their yardarms seemed to be actually
passing among the trees that cling stubbornly to
the rocky shore. It was the delight of the boy
Paul Jones to perch himself on the highest point
of the promontory, and to screech out his orders to
the incoming and outgoing vessels; and the shipmasters
soon found that this bold boy was as good
as a pilot any day, and if they followed his directions
they would always have water enough under
the keel.</p>

<p>The only school which Paul Jones ever attended
was the parish school at Kirkbean, and that only
until he was twelve years old. But it was characteristic
of him, as man and boy, to learn with
the greatest eagerness; and the result is shown in
his letters and language, which are far superior to
the average in those days. The habit of application
never left him, and he was a hard student all
his life.</p>

<p>There were many mouths to feed in the little
cottage at Arbigland, and in Paul Jones's thirteenth
year he was bound apprentice to a ship-master.
His first voyage was to Fredericksburg
in Virginia, where he had a brother, William Paul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>living,&mdash;a respected citizen. His time ashore was
spent with this brother, and so well did he conduct
himself that when William Paul died some
years later he left his estate to this favorite
younger brother. There were, however, many
years of toil before Paul Jones, and hardships
and buffetings, and even injustices that sank deep
into his sensitive soul. It is said that he was at
one time on a slave-ship, the slave-trade being
then legalized throughout the world; but, hating
the life, he quitted his ship, and the traffic too.
When he was about twenty years old, he found
himself without employment in Jamaica. He
embarked as a passenger on the John,&mdash;a fine
brigantine, owned by a shipping firm in his native
shire. On the voyage home both the captain and
the first mate died of yellow fever. The young
passenger&mdash;John Paul, as he was then called&mdash;took
command of the brigantine, and brought her
safely to her port. The owners rewarded him by
making him captain and supercargo of the John.
This shows that Paul Jones was not only a capable
seaman, worthy of command at twenty years
of age, but of integrity and steady habits as
well.</p>

<p>In his twenty-fourth year occurred an event
which gave him great anguish, and was probably
the reason of his leaving his native land. While
in command of a vessel in Tobago, he had his carpenter,
Maxwell, flogged for some offence. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>was the common mode of punishment in those
days. Maxwell complained to the Vice-Admiralty
Court, and the affair was investigated. The Court
examined Maxwell, and dismissed his charges
against Paul Jones, as frivolous. It is noted,
though, that Paul Jones expressed sorrow for
having had the man flogged. Maxwell shipped
on another vessel, but died a week or two afterward.
This put a much more serious aspect on
the matter. There was some talk of a prosecution
for murder; but it was shown that Maxwell's
death had nothing to do with the flogging, and it
was dropped. Nevertheless, the effect upon a
nature, at once arrogant and sensitive, like Paul
Jones's, was exquisitely painful. It is likely that
this case was the origin of the one weak point in
Paul Jones's tremendous naval genius: he was
never a good disciplinarian, and he seems always
to have hesitated too long before administering
punishments, and of course severer punishments
were needed thereby.</p>

<p>Upon his return to Scotland, he was coldly received
by his friends and neighbors. To Paul
Jones's mind this coolness assumed the form of a
persecution. He left his native country with resentment
in his heart against it, although he kept
up affectionate relations with his family. Many
years after, when he was one of the celebrities of
his age, he speaks in a letter of his grief at learning
of his mother's death, especially as he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>found that several sums of money which he had
sent her had never reached her.</p>

<p>He came to Virginia in 1773, and took possession
of the property left him by his brother, which
with his own savings gave him a competence.
Little is known of the particulars of his life from
1773 to 1775; but late researches show that his
friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and with other
persons of prominence in Virginia and North
Carolina, then began. Although his origin was
humble, his manners, tastes, and feelings led him
naturally into the most distinguished society, and
at a very early period in his career he is found
associated with persons of note.</p>

<p>On the first outbreak of hostilities with the
mother country Paul Jones offered his services to
the Continental Congress, and his name headed
the list of thirteen first lieutenants in the navy
appointed in December, 1775. Perhaps no man
had stronger natural and personal inclinations
toward the revolutionary cause than Paul Jones.
In his native country he was poor, obscure, and
perpetually barred out by his low estate from
those high places to which his vast ambition
aspired. In America, under a republican form
of government, he was as good as any man, provided
only he were worthy; and the fixed rank
of a naval officer would give him standing in
Europe among those very persons who would
otherwise have regarded him with contempt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>His commission was obtained through Mr.
Joseph Hewes, a member of Congress from
North Carolina, and the celebrated Robert Morris,
who was then at the head of the Marine Committee
of Congress. The influence of Thomas
Jefferson was also in his favor.</p>

<p>At this time his true career may be said to
have begun. He was then twenty-eight years
old, of "a dashing and officer-like appearance,"
his complexion dark and weather-beaten, and his
black eyes stern and melancholy in expression.
He had a slight hesitation in his speech which
disappeared under the influence of excitement.
His manner with sailors was said to be peculiarly
winning, and he was, no doubt, highly successful
in dealing with those characters which can be
gained by kindness and indulgence; but with
that part of mankind to whom severity is a necessity,
he does not seem to have been so well
adapted, and the evidences of a firm and consistent
discipline are wanting. When he came to
command a ship of his own,&mdash;which he did very
shortly,&mdash;he was extremely polite to the midshipmen,
frequently asking them to dine with him in
the cabin, but likely to blaze away at them if they
were not carefully and properly dressed for the
occasion. One of his officers, presuming upon
Paul Jones's indulgence, ventured to be insolent,
and got himself kicked down the hatchway for it.
It is said that when a midshipman on the topgallant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>yard was inattentive to his duty as a lookout,
Paul Jones himself would gently let go the halyards,
and the unlucky midshipman would come
down the yard on the run.</p>

<p>Paul Jones was extremely temperate in his
habits, and was naturally fond of order and decorum.
He had fixed religious principles, and, like
Washington, he considered a chaplain a useful and
even a necessary officer. A letter of his is extant
in which he says he would like a chaplain on
board who should be accommodated in the cabin,
and always have a seat at the cabin table, "the
government thereof should be entirely under his
direction." He was a tireless student by night,
his days at sea being occupied, when cruising, by
exercising his officers and men in their duty.</p>

<p>His first orders, as an American naval officer,
were as flag lieutenant on the Alfred, of twenty-four
guns, Commodore Hopkins's flagship. On
this ship Paul Jones claims to have hoisted with
his own hands the original flag of the Revolution&mdash;the
pine-tree and rattlesnake flag&mdash;the
first time it was ever displayed. This may well
be true, as such an act is thoroughly in keeping
with the romantic sentiment of Paul Jones's
character; and he says, "I think I feel the more
for its honour" on account of that circumstance.</p>

<p>Congress had assembled in the Delaware River
a fleet of five small vessels, and it was with
ardent hopes that Paul Jones joined this little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>squadron. In a very short while, though, he discovered
that Commodore Hopkins was very much
disinclined to "go in harm's way," to use one of
Paul Jones's favorite expressions, and his wrath
and disgust flamed out without any concealment.
The object of the cruise was to capture a lot of
stores, left unprotected by the British at the
island of New Providence. By Commodore Hopkins's
blundering the governor of the island had
time to save most of the stores. The Commodore
finding himself among the keys and islands of
the Bahamas, seems to have been afraid to go
away and afraid to stay where he was. Paul
Jones, however, taking a pilot up to the foretopmast
head with him, piloted the Alfred to a safe
anchorage. To crown all, the five vessels ran
across a little British frigate, the Glasgow, off
Newport, and after a smart cannonade the Glasgow
succeeded in slipping through Commodore
Hopkins's fingers and getting back to Newport.</p>

<p>Paul Jones's rage at this was furious, and it
became impossible for him to serve in the same
ship with Commodore Hopkins, who was shortly
afterward censured by Congress, and within the
year dismissed from the navy. In the summer of
1776 Paul Jones was given the command of a little
sloop, the Providence, mounting only twelve
four-pounders, but a fairly smart and weatherly
vessel. He improved her sailing qualities so
that she could log it faster than a great many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>better ships. With this little sloop he was employed
in conveying military stores from New England
to Washington's army on Long Island; and
as the coast and the sounds swarmed with the
cruisers of Lord Howe's fleet, this was a difficult
and daring undertaking. But in difficulty and
daring Paul Jones always shone, and he succeeded
so as to win the admiration and personal regard
of Washington, as well as the approval of Congress.
In the autumn he made a more extended
cruise, during which he captured several valuable
prizes, and showed his courage and seamanship
by man&oelig;uvring boldly before the Solebay frigate
and then running away from her. The Solebay
thought she had bagged the Providence, when the
little sloop, suddenly weathering her, ran directly
under her broadside, where the guns could not
be brought to bear, and went off before the wind
while the heavy frigate was coming about. On
another occasion he was chased by the Milford
frigate. Finding the Providence was fast enough
to play with the Milford, Paul Jones kept just out
of reach of the heavy cannonade of the Milford;
and every time the frigate roared out her heavy
guns, a marine, whom Paul Jones had stationed
aft on the Providence, banged away with his
musket in reply. This amused and delighted the
men, and when Paul Jones was ready he ran
away from the frigate, leaving her still thundering
away in his wake. These little events had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>good effect on his officers and men, showing them
that they had a man of dash and spirit for their
captain. When his cruise was up, he received
full recognition of his services by being appointed
to command a splendid frigate then building in
Holland for the American government. Meanwhile
he was ordered to take command of the
Ranger, a sloop-of-war, mounting eighteen light
guns, then fitting for sea at Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. On the very day he was appointed
to her, June 14, 1777, Congress adopted the stars
and stripes as the national ensign, and Paul Jones
always claimed that he was the first man to hoist
the new flag over a ship of war when he raised it
on the Ranger in Portsmouth harbor.</p>

<p>The Ranger was weakly armed and poorly
fitted. Her cabin furnishings were meagre enough,
but there were two bookcases full of books provided
by the captain. The Ranger sailed from Portsmouth
in November, 1777, and after an uneventful
voyage, arrived safely at Nantes in France in
December. Leaving his ship in charge of the
first lieutenant, Simpson, Paul Jones started for
Paris to confer with the three American Commissioners,
Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and
Arthur Lee. He bore a letter to them from the
Marine Committee describing him as "an active
and brave commander in our service." On reaching
Paris, a sharp disappointment awaited him concerning
the Holland frigate. Great Britain, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>was not then at war with either France or Holland,
although on the verge of it, had made complaints
about the frigate, and it had been passed
over to the French government to prevent its
confiscation. Paul Jones had a partial compensation,
however, in winning the affectionate regard
of Benjamin Franklin, and the friendship
that ever afterward subsisted between the impetuous
and sentimental Paul Jones and the
calm and philosophic Franklin was extremely
beautiful.</p>

<p>Despairing of getting any better ship than the
Ranger, Paul Jones set himself to work to improve
her sailing qualities; it is a striking fact
that he improved every ship he commanded, before
he was through with her.</p>

<p>Being ready to take the sea, he determined to
secure a salute to his flag from the splendid French
fleet commanded by M. de La Motte Piquet. He
took the Ranger to Quiberon Bay, and at once sent
a letter to the French admiral, announcing his
arrival, and another to the American agent at
L'Orient. Paul Jones's dealings with this agent
are laughable, as many of his transactions were.
He began, as usual, with the most formal politeness;
but as soon as there was any hesitation shown
in complying with his requests, which it cannot be
denied were perfectly sensible, he would blaze
out, and carry his point by the bayonet, as it were.
The agent did not understand the importance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the salute, and although he dined on board the
admiral's ship the day the request was made, he
failed to mention it to the admiral. This infuriated
Paul Jones, who wrote him a letter in which
he said, "I can show a commission as respectable
as any the French admiral can produce,"
and finally declared that unless the salute were
allowed, he would leave without entering the upper
bay at all.</p>

<p>His determined attitude had its effect. The
French admiral agreed to salute the Ranger, and
to make sure that it was done in broad daylight,
so there could be no misunderstanding about it,
Paul Jones kept his ship in the lower bay until
the next day. The French admiral paid the
American commander the compliment of having
the guns manned when the Ranger sailed through
the double line of the French fleet, and when the
French guns roared out in honor of the American
flag, it meant that France was from that day
openly, as she had been for some time secretly,
committed to an alliance with the struggling colonies.
Seeing that nothing was to be hoped for in
the way of a better ship, Paul Jones, like all truly
great men, determined to do the best he could with
the means at hand. So, on an April evening in
1777, he picked up his anchor and steered the little
Ranger straight for the narrow seas of Great
Britain, the Mistress of the Seas, and the greatest
naval power on earth. The boldness of this can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>scarcely be overestimated. The French admirals,
with fifty-five ships of the line, hung on to their
anchors, not caring to risk an encounter with the
fleets of England, manned by her mighty captains
and heroic crews; but Paul Jones, alone, in a
weak vessel, lightly armed, took all the chances
of destruction, and bearded the lion in his den.
He counted on the slowness of communication in
those days, and all of those other circumstances
in which fortune favors the brave,&mdash;and the
result justified him.</p>

<p>He cruised about for several days, burning and
destroying many merchant ships. He landed at
St. Mary's Isle, in order to capture the Earl of
Selkirk, but the bird had flown. His men became
mutinous, because, contrary to the custom of the
time, they were not allowed to loot the place.
Paul Jones was forced to allow them to carry off
some silver plate, which he afterward redeemed out
of his own pocket, and returned to Lady Selkirk.
He also landed at Whitehaven, and fired the shipping
in the port, although he did not succeed in
burning the vessels. But the desire of his heart
was to find a ship of war, not too strong for him,
with which he might fight it out, yardarm to yardarm.
This he found in the Drake, a sloop-of-war,
carrying twenty guns, and lying off Carrickfergus.
Like the Ranger, she was a weak ship; but
she carried brave men and a fighting captain,
and when, on the afternoon of the 24th of April,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>the Ranger appeared off Carrickfergus, the Drake
promptly came out to meet her. The tide was
adverse, and the Drake worked out slowly, but
her adversary gallantly waited for her in mid-channel,
with the American ensign at her mizzen
peak, and a jack at the fore. The Drake's hail,
"What ship is that?" was answered by the master,
under Paul Jones's direction: "This is the
American Continental ship Ranger. We wait
for you and beg you will come on. The sun is
but little more than an hour high, and it is time
to begin."</p>

<p>The Drake promptly accepted this cool invitation,
and the action began with the greatest
spirit. In an hour and four minutes the
Drake struck, after a brave defence. She had
lost her captain and first lieutenant, and thirty-eight
men killed and wounded, and had made,
as Paul Jones said, "a good and gallant defence."
The Ranger lost two men killed and
six wounded. On the 8th of May he arrived off
Brest in the Ranger, with the American ensign
hoisted above the union jack on the Drake. The
French pilots vied with each other as to which
should have the honor of piloting the two vessels
through the narrow channel known as Le Goulet,
and there was no question of a salute then,&mdash;every
French ship in sight saluted the plucky
little American.</p>

<p>This daring expedition gave Paul Jones a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>reputation in France. The French government,
by this time openly at war with England, asked
that Paul Jones remain in Europe to command a
naval force to be furnished by France; and he was
justified in expecting a splendid command. But
the maladministration of affairs in Paris left him
a whole year, idle and fretting and wretched, as
such bold spirits are, under hope deferred, and
at last he was forced to put up with an old Indiaman,
the Duc de Duras, larger, but not stronger
than the Ranger. He changed the name of this
old ship to the Bon Homme Richard, out of
compliment to Dr. Franklin, whose "Poor Richard's
Almanac" had just then appeared. She
was the flagship of a motley squadron of two
frigates besides the Bon Homme Richard; the
Alliance, an American frigate commanded by a
French captain, Landais, who was suspected to
be crazy, and acted like a madman; the Pallas,
commanded by another French captain, Cottineau,
a brave and skilful seaman; and a cutter and a
brig, neither of which was of consequence in the
cruise.</p>

<p>A number of American prisoners having been
exchanged and sent to France, Paul Jones was
enabled before he sailed to get about thirty
Americans for the Bon Homme Richard. Every
officer on the quarterdeck was a native American
except Paul Jones himself and one midshipman;
and the first lieutenant was Richard Dale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>one of the most gallant seamen the American
navy ever produced. He had lately escaped from
Mill Prison in England. Paul Jones justly appreciated
his young lieutenant, then only twenty-three
years old, and the utmost confidence and
attachment subsisted between them.</p>

<p>The crew was made up of men of all nationalities,
including a number of Malays, and many
of the fok'sle people did not understand the word
of command. With this singular squadron and
unpromising ship and crew Paul Jones set sail
on the 15th of August, under orders to report at
the Texel early in October. Great things were
expected of him, but agonizing disappointment
seemed to be in store for him. Landais, the
captain of the Alliance, was mutinous, and
the whole squadron seemed incapable of either
acting together or acting separately. Twice
Paul Jones sailed up the Firth of Forth as far
as Leith, the port of Edinburgh, and the Edinburghers
made preparations to withstand this
bold invader. Among the children who lay
awake at night waiting for the booming of
Paul Jones's guns, was a lad of ten years of
age,&mdash;Walter Scott, who, when he was the great
Sir Walter, often spoke of it. But both times
the wind blew Paul Jones out to sea again, so
that nothing was done in the way of a descent on
Edinburgh. Many merchant ships were taken,
and the coasts of the three kingdoms were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>alarmed, but so far no enemy in the shape of
a warship had appeared. The time for the
cruise to be up was fast approaching, and it
seemed likely to end in a manner crushing to the
hopes of Paul Jones, when, at noon on the 23d
of September, 1779, the Bon Homme Richard
being off Flamborough Head, a single ship was
seen rounding the headland. It was the first of
forty ships comprising the Baltic fleet of merchantmen,
which Paul Jones had expected and
longed to intercept. A large black frigate and
a smaller vessel were convoying them; and as
soon as the two warships had placed themselves
between the fleet and the Bon Homme Richard,
all the fighting ships backed their topsails and
prepared for action.</p>

<p>At the instant of seeing the two British ships,
Paul Jones showed in his air and words the delight
his warrior's soul felt at the approaching
conflict. His officers and crew displayed the utmost
willingness to engage, while on board the
Serapis her company asked nothing but to be
laid alongside the saucy American.</p>

<p>The Serapis was a splendid new frigate,&mdash;"the
finest ship of her class I ever saw," Paul
Jones afterward wrote Dr. Franklin,&mdash;and carried
fifty guns. It is estimated that her force, as
compared to the poor old Bon Homme Richard,
was as two to one. She was commanded by
Captain Pearson, a brave and capable officer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>At one o'clock the drummers beat to quarters
on both ships, but it was really seven o'clock
before they got near enough to begin the real
business of fighting. Much of this time the
British and Americans were cheering and jeering
at each other. The Serapis people pretended
they thought the Bon Homme Richard was a merchant
ship, which indeed she had been before she
came into Paul Jones's hands, and derisively
asked the Americans what she was laden with;
to which the Americans promptly shouted back,
"Round, grape, and double-headed shot!"</p>

<p>At last, about seven o'clock in the evening, the
cannonade began. At the second broadside two
of the battery of eighteen-pounders on the "Bon
Homme" burst, the rest cracked and could not
be fired. These had been the main dependence
for fighting the ship. Most of the small guns
were dismounted, and in a little while Paul Jones
had only three nine-pounders to play against the
heavy broadside of the Serapis. In addition
to this, the shot from the Serapis had made
several enormous holes in the crazy old hull of
the Bon Homme Richard, and she was leaking
like a sieve, while she was afire in a dozen places
at once. The crews of the exploded guns had no
guns to fight, but they had to combat both fire
and water, either of which seemed at any moment
likely to destroy the leaking and burning ship.
They worked like heroes, led by the gallant Dale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>and encouraged by their intrepid commander,
whose only comment on the desperate state of
the ship was, "Never mind, my lads, we shall
have a better ship to go home in."</p>

<p>Below, more than a hundred prisoners were
ready to spring up, and were only subdued by
Dale's determined attitude, who forced them to
work at the pumps for their lives. The Serapis
pounded her adversary mercilessly, and literally
tore the Bon Homme Richard to pieces between
decks. Most captains in this awful situation would
have hauled down the flag. Not so Paul Jones.
Knowing that his only chance lay in grappling
with his enemy and having it out at close quarters,
he managed to get alongside the Serapis,
and with his own hands made fast his bowsprit
to the Serapis' mizzen-mast, calling out cheerfully
to his men, "Now, my brave lads, we have
her!" Stacy, his sailing-master, while helping
him, bungled with the hawser, and an oath burst
from him. "Don't swear, Mr. Stacy," quietly said
Paul Jones, "in another moment we may be in
eternity; but let us do our duty."</p>

<p>The Alliance lay off out of gunshot and quite
inactive most of the time, but at this point she
approached and sailed around the two fighting
ships, firing broadsides into her consort, which
did dreadful damage. After this, her captain,
the crack-brained and treacherous Landais, made
off to windward and was seen no more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>The combat deepened, and apparently the Bon
Homme Richard was destined to go down fighting.
At one moment the two ships got into a position
in which neither could fire an effective shot. As
they lay, head and stern, fast locked in a deadly
embrace, and enveloped in smoke and darkness as
they repeatedly caught fire from each other, a
terrible stillness fell awhile, until from the
bloody decks of the Serapis a voice called
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you struck?"</p>

<p>To this Paul Jones gave back the immortal
answer, which will ever mark him among the
bravest of the brave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have not yet begun to fight!"</p>

<p>Soon the conflict was renewed. The Serapis'
heavy guns poured into and through the Bon
Homme Richard's hull, but the topmen on the
American ship kept up such a hurricane of destruction
on the Serapis' spar deck, that Captain
Pearson ordered every man below, while
himself bravely remaining. A topman on the
Bon Homme Richard, taking a bucket of hand
grenades, lay out on the main yard, which was
directly over the main hatch of the Serapis, and,
coolly fastening his bucket to the sheet block, began
to throw his grenades down the hatchway.
Almost the first one rolled down the hatch to the
gun-deck, where it ignited a row of cartridges
left exposed by the carelessness of the powder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>boys. In an instant came an explosion which
seemed to shake the heavens and the ocean.</p>

<p>This was the turning-point. The men in the
Bon Homme Richard's tops climbed into those of
the Serapis, the yards of the two ships being interlocked,
and swept her decks with fire and shot.
Dazed by the explosion, and helpless against the
American sharpshooters, the courageous men on
the Serapis saw themselves conquered, and Captain
Pearson himself lowered the flag which had
been nailed to the mast. Lieutenant Dale, swinging
himself on board the Serapis' deck, received
the captain's surrender; and thus ended one of the
greatest single ship fights on record. The slaughter
on both ships was fearful, and the Serapis'
mainmast went by the board just as she was given
up. But the poor Bon Homme Richard was past
help, and next morning she was abandoned. At
ten o'clock she was seen to be sinking. She gave
a lurch forward and went down, the last seen of
her being an American flag left flying by Paul
Jones's orders at her mizzen peak, as she settled
into her ocean grave.</p>

<p>The Pallas, under Captain Cottineau, had captured
the Countess of Scarborough, which made a
brave defence, and, in company with the Serapis,
sailed for the port of the Texel, which they
reached in safety. England scarcely felt the loss
of one frigate and a sloop from her tremendous
fleets, but the wound to the pride of a great and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>noble nation was severe. She caused the Dutch
government to insist that Paul Jones should
immediately leave the Texel. This he refused
to do, as it was a neutral port, and he had a right
to remain a reasonable time. The Dutch government
then threatened to drive him out, and had
thirteen double-decked frigates to enforce this
threat, while twelve English ships cruised outside
waiting for him. But Paul Jones kept his flag
flying in the face of these twenty-five hostile ships,
and firmly refused to leave until he was ready.
Through some complication with the French
government, he had the alternative forced upon
him of hoisting a French flag on the Serapis, or
taking the inferior Alliance under the American
flag. Bitter as it was to give up the splendid
Serapis, he nobly preferred the weaker ship,
under the American flag, and in the Alliance,
in the midst of a roaring gale on a black December
night, he escaped from the Texel, "with
my best American ensign flying," as he wrote Dr.
Franklin.</p>

<p>The British government offered ten thousand
guineas for him, dead or alive, and forty-two
British ships of the line and frigates scoured the
seas for him. Yet he escaped from them all,
passed within sight of the fleets at Spithead,
ran through the English Channel, and reached
France in safety. He went to Paris, where he
was praised, admired, petted by the court, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>especially honored by royalty. The King, Louis
XVI., gave him a magnificent sword, while the
Queen, the lovely and unfortunate Marie Antoinette,
invited him in her box at the opera,
and treated him with charming affability. The
first time he went to the theatre in Paris, he
found a laurel wreath suspended over his seat.
He rose quietly and moved away,&mdash;an act of
modesty which was much applauded by all.</p>

<p>Captain Pearson, on his return to England,
received honors that caused many persons to
smile, although he had undoubtedly defended
his ship very determinedly. He was made a
knight. When Paul Jones heard of this, he remarked:
"Well, he has deserved it; and if I
have the good fortune to fall in with him again,
I will make him a lord."</p>

<p>Compliments were plenty for Paul Jones, too;
but no ship was forthcoming for him worthy of
his fame, and at last, in 1780, he was forced to
return to America in the Ariel, a lightly armed
vessel, carrying stores for Washington's army.</p>

<p>His services were fully appreciated in the
United States. General Washington wrote him
a letter of congratulation; Congress passed a
resolution of thanks in his honor, and gave him
a gold medal; and the French king made him a
Knight of the Order of Military Merit. The
poverty of his country prevented him from getting
a ship immediately, and the virtual end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>war in 1781 gave him no further opportunity of
naval distinction.</p>

<p>He was employed in serving the naval interests
of the country on this side of the ocean until 1787,
when he went to Europe on a mission for the
government. While there, he had brilliant offers
made him to enter the service of the Empress
Catherine of Russia, and to take charge of naval
operations against the Turks. The nature of
Paul Jones was such that any enterprise of adventurous
daring was irresistibly attractive to him.
At that time his firm friend Thomas Jefferson
was minister to France, and he advised Paul
Jones to accept the offer. This he did, relying,
as he said, on Mr. Jefferson to justify him in so
doing, and retaining his American citizenship.
He had an adventurous journey to Russia, stopping
for a while on public business at Copenhagen,
where he was much caressed by the King, Queen,
and Court. He resumed his route by sea, and at
one time in a small boat in the Baltic Sea he
forced the sailors to proceed at the point of his
pistol, when their hearts failed them and they
wished to turn back.</p>

<p>His connection with the Russian navy proved
deeply unfortunate. He had to deal with persons
of small sense of honor, who cared little for
the principles of generous and civilized warfare.
He was maligned and abused, and although he
succeeded in clearing himself, he left Russia with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>disappointment and disgust. His health had begun
to fail, and the last two years of his life, from
1790 to 1792, were spent in Paris, where he was
often ill, and more often in great distress of mind
over the terrible scenes then occurring in France.
He did not forget that the King and Queen had
been his friends, and showed them attentions
when it was extremely dangerous to do so. Lafayette,
who had long been his devoted friend,
soothed his last days; and Gouverneur Morris,
then minister to France, paid him many kind
attentions. He made his will, naming Robert
Morris as his executor, and then faced death
with the same cool courage as upon the
bloody and burning deck of the Bon Homme
Richard.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 18th of July, 1792, after
calmly making his preparation, the end came.
The National Assembly of France paid honor to
his remains, and in the United States the news of
his death was received with profound sorrow.
Some years after, the Congress sent the St. Lawrence
frigate to Europe, to bring back the body of
Paul Jones to the United States; but it was found
that, according to the French custom, it had been
destroyed by quicklime long before.</p>

<p>Few men have been more warmly attacked and
defended than Paul Jones; but in the light of history
and of research it is altogether certain that
he was a man of extraordinary genius and courage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>of noble aspirations, and sincerely devoted to
his adopted country; and at all times and places
he made good his proud declaration: "I have
ever looked out for the honor of the American
flag."</p>

<p>The eulogy passed upon him by Benjamin
Franklin was brief, but it embodied many volumes
of praise. It was this: "For Captain Paul
Jones ever loved close fighting."</p>

<h2>RICHARD DALE.</h2>


<p>If an example were needed of the superiority
of character and courage over intellect, no more
fitting person could be named than Commodore
Richard Dale,&mdash;"that truth-telling and truth-loving
officer," as Fenimore Cooper calls him.
Nothing is more beautiful than the reverence
which Cooper, a man of real genius, had for
Richard Dale, whose talents, though good, were
not brilliant; and in this Cooper shows to lesser
minds that intellect should ever pay tribute to
character. Dale had nothing more than good,
sound sense, but by the courage and constancy of
his nature, by his justice, gentleness, and probity,
he attained a standing of which a great intellect
might have been proud. He was Paul Jones's
first lieutenant during two years of daring adventure,
and, like Cooper, Paul Jones, the man of
genius, loved and admired Dale, the man of excellence.
The affection between the two was deep,
and in Dale's old age he spoke of his old commander,
then no more, affectionately as "Paul,"&mdash;a
strong testimony in the great captain's favor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_034a"></a>
  <img src="images/i_034a.jpg" width="400" height="484" alt="Richard Dale" />

<img src="images/i_034b.jpg" width="400" height="121" alt="Richard Dale signature" />
</div>

<p>Dale was born near Norfolk, in Virginia, in
1756. His parents were respectable persons, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>not very well off, and Dale appears to have had
but few advantages of education in his boyhood.
He was, by nature, a daring and reckless speller,
and the ingenuity and simplicity with which he
could twist the letters of the alphabet into forms
never before seen, was truly comical. In a letter
to Paul Jones, describing some work he was doing
on the bowsprit, he says, "the boulsprit was
something Dificoult in Giting out." But no doubt
the bowsprit was smartly handled, and got out all
right. And when "tow french voluntairs" deserted,
Dale says he "made haist" to send the
"golly-boat" after them, and certainly got them,
if it were possible to do so. But in spite of his
spelling, he was educated in all the courtesies of
life, his manners were polished, his person was
handsome, and he was a daring and capable seaman.
Paul Jones said he always found Dale
ready and willing to execute the most hazardous
duty; and this willingness to do his duty was the
distinguishing characteristic of his whole life.</p>

<p>When he was twelve years of age, he entered
the merchant service and made a voyage with
an uncle of his, a sea-captain. Then began his
career of hard knocks; and few men who sail
blue water ever had more. He began by falling
down the hold of his ship, and breaking most of
his bones except those of his back and neck; then
followed experiences of being knocked overboard
and battling in the sea an hour before being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>picked up; of being struck by lightning and remaining
unconscious for hours. From the time
he joined the navy of the colonies, he never was
in action without being either wounded or captured
and sometimes both. Three times was he
badly wounded, five times was he taken prisoner;
yet he managed to be in active service
during a great part of the war, and at last died
peacefully in his bed, at a good old age.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as war was declared, Dale, then
a fine young fellow of nineteen, enlisted in the
feeble naval forces of the colonies; and the very
first time he smelled powder, in 1776, he was
captured by the British and taken to Norfolk.
There he was put on board a prison ship, where
he found among the officers an old friend of his,
a young Virginian, Bridges Gutteridge. Gutteridge
was a royalist, and, being a plausible
fellow, he used his friendship with Dale to persuade
him that he was wrong in being in rebellion.
Dale, who was young and inexperienced,
was beguiled by his friend into turning royalist
too, and actually enlisted upon a small British
vessel. The first action in which he was engaged&mdash;a
fight with American pilot boats&mdash;Dale met
his usual fate, and was severely wounded. He
was carried back to Norfolk, and in the long days
of illness and convalescence he began to see his
conduct in its true light, and bitterly repented
of having fought against his country. He went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>to work upon his friend Gutteridge, and succeeded
in converting him, after once having been converted
by him, into a patriot. Dale then quietly
bided his time to get back into the American
navy, and, as he said, "I made up my mind if I
got into the way of bullets it should never again
be the bullets of my own country."</p>

<p>It is indicative of the simple honesty of the
man, that he never attempted to belittle or disguise
this early lapse of his, and always expressed
the deepest sorrow for it, alleging what a nature
less fine would never have admitted, "I knew no
better at the time."</p>

<p>As soon as he was recovered, he managed to
get aboard a merchant ship; to go to sea was
the first step toward returning to the continental
navy, which was the desire of his heart. He
was captured as usual. But this time it was
just the very sort of a capture that Dale desired,
his ship being taken by the Lexington, a smart
little cruiser under the command of Captain
Barry, a brave officer, with whom Dale's life
was afterward much connected. Dale lost not a
moment in enlisting as midshipman on the Lexington,
and the first time she backed her topsails
at a British vessel she was captured, and Dale
was a prisoner for the third time.</p>

<p>An officer and a prize crew were thrown on the
Lexington, and her captor, the Pearl, frigate,
directed the prize to follow her. In the night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>the Americans rose on their captors, and retook
the brig, carrying her into Baltimore. Soon
after that, Dale was exchanged, and in January,
1777, he found himself again on the Lexington,
as master's mate. In March, the brig sailed for
France, under Captain Henry Johnson, and cruised
boldly in European waters.</p>

<p>One night, in September, 1777, Captain Johnson
found himself close under the quarter of a
well-armed British cutter. The two gallant little
vessels opened fire with great spirit, and the
Americans were getting decidedly the better of
it, when their shot gave out. Dale and the other
officers collected every scrap of iron about the
ship that could be found or wrenched from its
place to fire in the place of shot, but the unequal
fight could not last long; the brig was
given up after several of her officers and men
had been killed, and Dale was a prisoner for the
fourth time before he was twenty-one years old.</p>

<p>In most of these revolutionary encounters the
ships engaged were of trifling force, but the
attack and defence were gallant and spirited in
the highest degree, by both the Americans and
the British, and no ship was given away on either
side.</p>

<p>The Lexington's officers and men were carried
to England and thrown into Mill Prison, where
they underwent the agonies of famine and privation.
Dale always spoke of those dreadful days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>with horror, and told of being driven by hunger
to kill a stray dog, which he, with the other
prisoners, cooked and ate.</p>

<p>The story of their sufferings got abroad and
excited the indignation of many persons in England,
who were jealous of the honor of their
country. They raised sixteen thousand pounds
for American prisoners in England, and relieved
all their material wants. But the Americans
longed for liberty, and Dale and a few others
determined to have it. They found a place under
the prison walls through which a hole could be
dug, and they began the almost impossible task
of scooping out enough earth that they might
crawl through to the other side. They could
work only while exercising in the prison yard,
and had to put the dirt in their pockets as they
scooped it up. Nevertheless, after working for
weeks at it, on a dark night in February, 1778,
Captain Johnson, Dale, and several of the Lexington's
crew crawled through, and found themselves
free at last of the prison walls.</p>

<p>It is strange that men who could accomplish
this should have been so unwise as to stay together,
but for a week the whole party wandered
about the country at night, half starved and half
clothed, in the worst of wintry weather. At last
they concluded to separate, and Dale and a young
midshipman cast their lots together. Their character
was soon suspected by people they asked for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>food and shelter, and pursuers were put upon
them. They doubled on their tracks and got to
London. They were still hunted for, and the
house in which they were concealed was raided.
Dale and his friend escaped into a shed close by,
and lay concealed under straw for hours, until
the pursuing party had left. They then slipped
down to the docks, and were entered as hands on
a vessel for Scotland. But Dale's usual ill-fortune
followed him. The British navy, wanting able
seamen, sent a press gang to the Scotch vessel,
and Dale and his friend, unluckily attracting
notice by their stalwart appearance, were impressed.
In a little while they were found out
to be American officers, and were sent back to
Mill Prison. Forty days in the black hole of the
prison followed. When this was over, Dale
earned another forty days in it by singing rebel
songs. He continued to sing his songs, though,
while in the black hole. After a whole year in
prison he made his escape under circumstances
which he never revealed to the day of his death,
except that he had on a complete suit of British
uniform. How he got it remains a mystery, and
from that day until his death, forty-seven years
afterward, Dale kept the dangerous secret of the
person who risked so much for him. It is supposed
that he was provided liberally with money,
and even with a passport, for he got out of
England quickly and went to France. Here, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>L'Orient, he found Paul Jones, then fitting out
the Bon Homme Richard, in which both the commander
and Dale were to win immortality.</p>

<p>Dale was then an active, handsome young
fellow of twenty-three, and had seen more hard
service than many officers of the highest rank.
At the first glance Paul Jones saw his steadiness,
coolness, and splendid qualities as a sea officer,
and soon made him first lieutenant on the Bon
Homme Richard. A deep attachment sprang
up between these two kindred souls, and it is
enough for Dale's reputation to know that he
was a man after Paul Jones's own heart.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1779 the Bon Homme
Richard, old, crazy, and weakly armed, but
carrying as much valor as any ship afloat, started
upon her daring cruise in the narrow seas of
Great Britain. Every day showed Paul Jones
more and more the admirable character of his
young first lieutenant, and in all the hazardous
enterprises of that bold cruise Dale was the
man who was always Paul Jones's right arm of
strength. On the 23d of September, 1779, was
fought the celebrated battle between the Bon
Homme Richard and the Serapis. Dale was
not only the first, but the only sea lieutenant on
board, and proved himself altogether worthy to
serve under the great captain who took the
Serapis. He commanded the main deck, and,
although his wretched and defective guns soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>became disabled, his activity did not cease for a
moment.</p>

<p>At the most critical stages of the battle, when
the leaking, burning, and helpless Bon Homme
Richard seemed in extremity, the master-at-arms
let loose more than a hundred prisoners, who
came crowding up into the magazine passage.
Dale, running below, with his pistol cocked, faced
the mob, and, under Paul Jones's orders, set them
to work at the pumps. He then returned to the
deck, and so carried away was he with the ardor
of battle that when, with his invariable fortune, a
shot struck him in the leg, he was quite unconscious
of it. As soon as Captain Pearson hauled
down his flag, Dale claimed his right to go aboard
the Serapis and receive her surrender. The
mainyard of the Serapis hung cock-a-bill over
the Bon Homme Richard's poop. A line hung
from the torn rigging, and Dale, seizing it, swung
himself over, and landed alone on the Serapis'
deck. The Serapis' officers and people did not
all know the colors had been struck, and there
was some fighting on the deck afterward. The
Serapis' first lieutenant ran up just as Captain
Pearson surrendered, and cried out, "Has she
struck?" meaning the Bon Homme Richard.
Captain Pearson remained silent, and Dale replied,
"No, sir, the Serapis has struck."</p>

<p>The lieutenant, ignoring Dale, repeated his
question to the captain, who shook his head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>The lieutenant after a moment asked that he
might go below and stop the firing that had
not altogether ceased; but Dale, who was not
taking any chances of losing the ship, politely
refused, and at once passed the captain and
his first lieutenant aboard the Bon Homme
Richard.</p>

<p>As soon as the Americans had possession of
the Serapis, Dale sat down on the binnacle,
overcome with exhaustion, after nearly ten hours
of man&oelig;uvring and fighting, two hours of the
time the ships having been lashed together. He
gave an order, and, rising to see it executed,
measured his length on the deck. Then for the
first time he knew that he was wounded. He
managed to keep the deck, however, and his
wound proved to be trifling.</p>

<p>In all the accounts of the compliments showered
upon Paul Jones and his officers at the
Texel and afterward at Paris, Dale seems to have
kept modestly in the background. His worth,
however, was not overlooked, and his testimony
that Captain Landais of the Alliance had acted
treacherously toward the Bon Homme Richard
during the fight with the Serapis was of weight
in securing Landais' dishonorable discharge from
the continental navy.</p>

<p>While Paul Jones was enjoying the charms
and splendors of Paris, Dale, who had little
taste for such things, was "keeping ship" so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>well that the captain's absence was not felt.
Like Paul Jones, he ardently longed to put to
sea in a fine ship; but both were doomed to
disappointment when the Ariel was the best to
be had. In her he sailed, with Paul Jones, for
America, in 1781. Off the French coast they
met with a storm so terrific that Dale always
declared he considered they were in more danger
than at any time during the fight with the
Serapis. In speaking of Paul Jones's coolness
in such desperate straits, when every moment
they seemed about to go to the bottom, Dale said:
"Never saw I such coolness in such dreadful circumstances
as I saw in Paul Jones then." To
the amazement of all, they escaped with their
lives, although the Ariel was so crippled that
they had to return to port, and it was many
weeks before they could sail again.</p>

<p>On reaching America, Paul Jones desired Dale
to accompany him to Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
where the government directed him to superintend
the building of a fine frigate then on
the stocks. But Dale preferred active service,
and joined the Trumbull frigate, going through
with his usual experience, a hot fight with a British
ship and a severe wound. This time he varied
the performance by being captured for the fifth
time. He was soon exchanged, however, and the
war ended shortly after.</p>

<p>The navy of the United States ceased practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>to exist at the close of the Revolution, and
Dale went into the China trade. He made a
modest fortune, came ashore, and married a beautiful
girl, the ward of his old commander Captain
Barry. In 1794 the navy was reorganized, and
Dale was the first captain who got afloat under
the United States flag. He made several cruises,
and in 1801 was made commodore of a fine
squadron sent to the Mediterranean. His flagship
was the President, and it was a sad coincidence
that upon this very ship, in the war of
1812, his son, a gallant young midshipman, received
his death wound.</p>

<p>The fine appearance of the American ships and
the smartness of their officers and crews were
generally admired, and Dale himself made friends
and admirers by his manly and modest bearing.
He spelled no better than ever, but his seamanship
was beyond reproach. Once, on coming out
of Port Mahon, the President struck upon a
rock, and was in imminent danger of pounding
herself to death. Commodore Dale was below
when she struck. He instantly came on deck,
assumed command, and by his coolness, nerve,
and judgment, saved the ship. He had her temporarily
repaired, under his own directions, at
Port Mahon, but went to Toulon to have her put
in dry dock. When the water was pumped out,
and her hull exposed, the French naval officers
were lost in admiration at the ingenious way in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>which, with crude appliances and materials, Dale
had contrived to repair the damage.</p>

<p>The great Nelson, while observing the man&oelig;uvring
of this fine squadron under Commodore Dale,
remarked: "Those American ships can, if they
wish, make trouble for the British navy."</p>

<p>Dale returned home, expecting to spend the rest
of his active life in the navy. But in those days
it seems to have been a common practice to treat
the most distinguished and deserving officers without
the least consideration of their rights or feelings.
This happened to Commodore Dale. An
affront being offered him by the head of the navy,
he promptly resigned. He had two gallant sons
who remained in the navy, however; and one of
these, his namesake, lost his life while gallantly
fighting in the war of 1812. Dale retired to
Philadelphia, and spent the rest of his days in
honorable retirement. His old friend Captain
Barry had come into possession of the splendid
gold sword given Paul Jones by the King of
France, and which Paul Jones's relatives had
given to Robert Morris, and from him Captain
Barry got it. On Captain Barry's death he left
this sword, most worthily and appropriately, to
Dale, the great captain's first lieutenant.</p>

<p>Dale never lost his interest in sailors and all
who live by the sea. He was a deeply religious
man, and organized a mariners' church, which he
urged all sailors to attend. Every Sunday afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>for thirty years he went to this humble little
chapel, and, besides joining in the service, would
go about among the sailors who were present,
gently inquiring into their wants, and never failing
to do a kindness for them when possible. It
is said that no man was ever heard to speak a
word against him. He died peacefully, after a
short illness, in 1826. The United States named
for him a fine sloop of war, which, like Dale himself,
saw much service and had many vicissitudes.
She is still in existence, and when, a few years
ago, her timbers were examined, they were found
as sound and whole, in spite of all her years of
service, as they ought to be in a ship named
for a man like Richard Dale. In her main
gangway a memorial plate is placed, recalling
Commodore Dale's services in the fight between
the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis, and
quoting the never-to-be-forgotten words of Paul
Jones, when he was asked, in his almost helpless
ship, if he had struck,&mdash;"I have not yet
begun to fight."</p>

<h2>THOMAS TRUXTUN.</h2>


<p>In the old days the American sailors were great
singers, and naval songs, rude in construction
but vivid with patriotic fire, were immensely popular.
When they were trolled forth on the fok'sle,
nearly every sailor could join in, and the effect
was as inspiring as Dibdin's songs were to the
British navy about the same time. Among the
first and favorite of these songs was "Truxtun's
Victory," beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, all ye Yankee sailors, with swords and pikes advance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'T is time to try your courage and humble haughty France."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a good deal of poetic license regarding
facts as well as forms, and the poet, in describing
Truxtun's victory on L'Insurgente, a crack
French frigate, represents</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The blood did from their scuppers run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their captain cried, 'I am undone!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Instead of crying that he was undone, the French
captain made a gallant defence; and if his metal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>had been heavier, it might have been "Barreault's
Victory," instead of "Truxtun's Victory."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;"><a id="i_050"></a>
<img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="317" height="600" alt="Medal awarded to Thomas Truxtun" />
  <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Medal awarded to Thomas Truxtun</span></span>
</div>

<p>Thomas Truxtun was born in New York in
1755, but, losing his father early, was taken to
Jamaica by a relative and brought up. He had
but little chance of a school education, and went
to sea early. He was but twenty years old when
the Revolution broke out, and was then in command
of a merchant vessel. Unfortunately it
cannot be recounted that Truxtun entered the
American navy then. Instead he chose serving
in a privateer. But it must be remembered that
the whole naval force of the colonies was very
feeble, and so slight was the expectation that it
could prevail against the mighty fleets of England
that only a few small ships were officered,
and there was no more room for would-be officers.
Truxtun, however, did excellent service in privateers,&mdash;usually
not very honorable ships in themselves,
as they prey only on the commerce of an
enemy; yet in the Revolution many privateers
boldly engaged with armed ships. Naturally the
naval men held privateers in contempt, and a letter
of the great Paul Jones is extant which shows
that he and young Captain Truxtun had a sharp
quarrel over the rights of privateers. Congress
had passed an act forbidding a privateer to hoist
a pennant in the presence of a naval ship, without
first getting the consent of the naval ship's
commander. Truxtun, an impetuous young man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>of twenty-five, in command of the ship Independence
from Philadelphia, arrived at L'Orient
in France in 1780. At the same time the Ariel,
under command of Paul Jones, was lying in the
port. What followed Paul Jones himself describes
in a letter addressed to "Mr. Thomas Truxtun,
master of the ship Independence."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You passed, some time ago, with the merchant
ship called the Independence belonging to Philadelphia,
close under the stern of the continental ship
Ariel, under my command in the Road of Groix;
and you then showed no mark of respect to the Continental
flag of commission, but went on with a long
Pendant flying, and without lowering any sail or
colour, or crew showing any mark of politeness. In
the port of L'Orient you were not satisfied with a
long Pendant, but you hoisted a kind of Broad one;
and until yesterday you have worn it at your moorings
in presence of the Continental ship Ariel.
This was flying in the Face of a positive resolution
of Congress. When your vessel was yesterday
under sail, she was steered in my presence very
near the Ariel in passing down to Port Louis. I
then sent a Boat with an officer to request yourself
or your representative to take down the Pendant.
The officer returned and reported to me that my
boat's crew had been menaced by your people, and
that your mate said he had Orders to treat me with
Contempt, and disobey any order or request to haul
down the Pendant. When I found this, I sent
Lieut. Dale back with two Boats armed, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>another polite message, and such orders as I will
answer for having given. The Pendant was then
hauled Down as he approached. I cannot answer
your letter of this date more particularly, as there
are in it several words that I do not understand and
cannot find in the dictionary. I shall receive no
more letters from you on the subject. It is not me
you have offended. You have offended the United
States of America. I am, sir, your most humble
servant,</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"<span class="smcap">J. Paul Jones</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>By this letter it will be seen that Captain
Truxtun, like Richard Dale, was better at fighting
than writing; and it will also be noted that
when Paul Jones's blood was up, he sent Dale to
call Captain Truxtun to account, and as soon as
Dale took the matter in hand, "the Pendant was
then hauled down."</p>

<p>Truxtun had an adventurous time of it during
the Revolution, and made a name for himself as a
man of enterprise and a fine seaman. His after
achievements make it a source of keen regret
that such a man should have been engaged in
such a calling as privateering, when, like Paul
Jones and Richard Dale, he might have assisted
his country much better on a regular ship of
war.</p>

<p>He remained in the merchant service after the
war was over; but when the United States began
to create a navy in 1784, Truxtun was given a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>captain's commission. Trouble had been brewing
with France for some time, and in 1797 the government
determined to build several frigates in
case of war, and this year saw the launching of
the two noble ships, the Constitution and the
Constellation, which were both destined to win
immortal fame. Truxtun was appointed to command
the Constellation, and also to superintend
the building. She was laid down at Baltimore in
the summer of 1797, and few ships ever took the
water more quickly than the glorious Constellation.
She had a very remarkable launch on the
7th of September, 1797. Nearly all her guns and
stores were on board, and seven days after she
kissed the water she was ready to sail. She
had been coppered in ten hours. The Constellation
was a beautiful frigate, very fast and weatherly,
and carrying thirty-eight guns. She was
finely officered and manned, and Captain Truxtun
sailed on his first cruise with every advantage in
his favor,&mdash;a ship that could both fight and run,
and a company worthy of the ship. He cruised
for some time without meeting with any extraordinary
adventures; but the next year four other
smaller vessels were put under his command, and
the squadron went to the West Indies. This was
directly in harm's way, as the West India islands
were full of French ships of war, and France and
the United States were on the eve of a quasi-war,
so that Captain Truxtun sailed with the hope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>getting a whack at a Frenchman, and this came
about in February, 1799. As the old song has it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'T was in the month of February, off Montserrat we lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When there we spied the Insurgente&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was considered to be the fastest frigate in
the world, and was commanded by a crack French
captain, Barreault. She carried forty twelve-pounders
in her batteries, and the Constellation
carried thirty-eight twenty-four pounders, making
the Constellation much the stronger ship; yet
Captain Truxtun showed, in the fight which followed,
that he could have whipped a heavier ship
than L'Insurgente, which made a very smart fight
too. Captain Barreault knew that the Constellation
was the heavier, but he did not on that account
refuse the battle, but showed a manly willingness
to fight.</p>

<p>The Constellation sighted L'Insurgente in the
forenoon of February 9, 1799, and immediately
made for her. As soon as she got near enough,
the French ship hoisted American colors, in order
to draw her on and give the French ship
time to find out something about the stranger.
Captain Truxtun then showed the private signal,
which Captain Barreault was unable to answer.
L'Insurgente then threw off every disguise, and,
setting the French ensign, ran off and fired a gun
to windward, which meant, in sailor language,
that he was ready for a yardarm to yardarm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>fight. Captain Truxtun set an American ensign
at every masthead and came on, the Frenchman
waiting on an easy bowline, for his enemy. The
Americans, both officers and men, showed the
most cheerful ardor to engage, and the two
ships went at it with equal spirit. When within
hailing distance the Frenchman hailed; but disregarding
this, Captain Truxtun came on until
he was abeam of his adversary. Then he let fly
his broadside, and the Frenchman answered him
promptly. Captain Truxtun discovered that he
had no fool to play with in Captain Barreault,
and for an hour the Frenchman gave the Constellation
all she could do. But by that time
the superior metal of the Constellation began to
tell. The Frenchman aimed at the spars and
rigging, and the foretopmast of the Constellation
was badly wounded. The officer in the
foretop was Midshipman David Porter, afterward
the celebrated captain, and, seeing that the foretopmast
was likely to fall, with all the men in
the hamper, he hailed the deck to report the
damage. So furious was the cannonade, though,
that his voice could not be heard. He therefore
gave orders on his own account to cut away the
stoppers and lower the topsail yard, and by his
promptness the spar as well as the men in the top
were saved. The Americans aimed at the hull,
and in an hour L'Insurgente was riddled like a
sieve. The Constellation then shot ahead, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>luffing across the Frenchman's bows, was ready
with every gun to rake him, when Captain Barreault,
seeing his hopeless condition, struck his
colors.</p>

<p>The captured frigate was sent into St. Kitts
with only two midshipmen, Porter and Rodgers,
and eleven men, to keep one hundred and seventy
three Frenchmen below the hatches. This they
did, besides managing the ship in a hard gale,
and took her in triumph to St. Kitts within four
days.</p>

<p>The next year Captain Truxtun had a chance
to show what he could do against a stronger ship
than his own, and on the 1st of February, 1800,
being off Guadeloupe, he sighted La Vengeance,
one of the great French frigates, mounting fifty-two
guns. The Constellation immediately set
her ensign and gave chase, but La Vengeance,
having on board a large number of officers of
rank and soldiers which she was carrying to
France, would rather not have fought, and so
took to her heels. The chase continued from the
morning of the 1st of February until late in the
afternoon of the 2d, and it was eight o'clock
at night before they finally came to close quarters.
When La Vengeance found the Constellation was
bent on a fight, she entered into it with all the
bravery of the French character. The officers
and soldiers she was carrying as passengers went
to quarters with the regular crew, and she came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>on in grand style, giving her first broadside as
soon as the Constellation was within range.
Captain Truxtun, without firing a gun, drew
within pistol shot of his enemy, both crews cheering
as the two gallant enemies neared each other.
When within pistol shot, the Constellation barked
out every gun in broadside, and the fight began
in good earnest. Both ships were running
free, and during the whole fight, which lasted
five hours, the cannonade continued. The crowded
condition of the Frenchman's decks made the
slaughter dreadful, but she did not take her punishment
without giving it back with spirit. The
moon had risen in tropic splendor, and a good
breeze was blowing, so that both ships could
man&oelig;uvre, and the bright light enabled them to
see what they were doing. Toward midnight,
though, it was plain that the French ship was
getting the worst of it. However, she showed no
signs of surrender, and her guns that could still
be worked pounded the mainmast of the Constellation
until it was soon seen that it must fall.
At this point occurred what is probably the
noblest act of young courage in all naval history.
The officer of the maintop was a little midshipman,
James Jarvis, who was only thirteen years
old. When it was seen that nothing could save
the mainmast, the topmen leaped and clambered
down, and an old sailor begged the little
midshipman to save himself. To this young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Jarvis answered calmly, "As an officer I cannot
leave my station, and if the mast goes, I must go
with it." In a few moments the great mast fell
with a fearful crash, and this dauntless boy came
down with it. He was the only officer on the
Constellation killed.</p>

<p>This accident rendered the Constellation helpless
for a time, and La Vengeance, having still
spars enough left to get away, made off, without
firing another gun, and was soon lost in the
darkness that followed the setting of the moon.
Her loss of men was frightful, while that of the
Constellation was comparatively small.</p>

<p>When Captain Truxtun reached home after
this brilliant engagement, he was received with
acclamations, Congress gave him a gold medal
and its thanks, and passed a solemn resolution in
honor of young Jarvis, "who gloriously preferred
certain death to the abandonment of his post."
This is, perhaps, an unprecedented honor for a
boy of thirteen, but it cannot be denied that the
little midshipman, who deliberately gave his life
rather than desert his post, well earned it.</p>

<p>The London merchants of Lloyd's coffee-house
sent Captain Truxtun a splendid service of plate
worth six hundred guineas, and some years afterward
the United States named a smart sloop of
war after him, the Truxtun. Captain Truxtun
served but a short while in the navy after this.
In 1802 he was ordered, as Commodore, to command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>a squadron, and, finding he was to have
no captain on his flag-ship, declined the honor.
His letter was misunderstood by the authorities
of the Navy Department to mean a resignation
from the navy, and was, as such, accepted.
Commodore Truxtun, too proud to withdraw it,
chose rather to withdraw from the navy,&mdash;a
course which must ever be regretted. He chose
Philadelphia as his home, and became a prominent
and important citizen. He was for some
time Sheriff of the city. In 1823 his death
occurred, and he left behind him an honorable
name as a man, and a brilliant reputation as a
seaman.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM BAINBRIDGE.</h2>


<p>Commodore Bainbridge was born at Princeton,
New Jersey, in 1774. His family were of good
standing, and willing as well as able to give the
boy a liberal education; but an inborn love of
adventure possessed him, and he begged to be
allowed to go to sea. At that time, 1789-90,
the navy of the Revolution had ceased to exist,
while the navy of a later date was not created,
and the only way to gratify the boy was to send
him to sea in a merchant vessel. He first shipped
in his sixteenth year, and his good habits and
natural genius for the sea gave him the place of
first officer of a ship when he was eighteen.
During a voyage to Holland a mutiny occurred
on board his vessel, which was quelled chiefly by
the vigor and determination of young Bainbridge.
The owners rewarded his services by giving him
the command of the ship when he was barely
nineteen. At this time he was a singularly handsome
young man. He was six feet high, his figure
elegant, and his countenance as frank and open
as it was comely. His manners were cordial, and
his disposition impetuous; but although he sometimes
fell into hasty and passionate language, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>man was more ready to make amends. Like Paul
Jones, he stammered slightly, but, also like him,
he spoke smoothly enough when there was occasion
for it, and no one ever heard him halt in
his speech when an order aboard ship was to be
given.</p>

  <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">William Bainbridge</span></span>
</div>

<p>Bainbridge remained in command of merchant
ships until the reorganization of the navy in 1798.
During those years a singular and unsatisfactory
state of affairs existed for American ships on the
ocean. Without a single ship of war to protect
them, they were liable to be overhauled by British
warships, which claimed the right to search, by
French warships, which practically fought and
captured them, while a large trade with the North
of Europe and the East was harassed by the corsairs
of the Barbary coast. With regard to these
last, a truly disgraceful condition prevailed. The
Dey of Algiers actually demanded and received
tribute from the United States government for
not molesting its trading-vessels! It is true that
other nations of Europe submitted to the same
sort of blackmail; but their reasons, although not
sufficient, were better than those of the Americans.
New in the art of forming a great republic, and
unduly fearful of the dangers of a fixed naval
force as well as of a standing army, the government
of the United States tried to do without
a navy; but it paid for its mistake many times
over, both in national honor and in money. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>European nations also paid money to the Barbary
pirates, and allowed their ships to be used in
various ways, at the request of these haughty
despots; but it was with a desire to secure their
political alliances in the universal wars that
scourged Europe at that day, and not from inability
to protect their own carrying ships.</p>

<p>It may be imagined how galling this was to
American captains, and that they resisted whenever
there was a chance of success. Young
Bainbridge was the last man to submit to coercion
when he could help himself, and on two
occasions, while in command of merchant vessels,
showed the spirit that was in him. Once, when
commanding the Hope, a little vessel carrying
only eleven men before the mast and four nine-pounders,
he fell in with a British privateer,
carrying thirty men and eight guns. A sharp
action ensued; for privateers are not wont to
heed any vessel's rights when the privateer is the
stronger party, and Paul Jones's characterization
of them as "licensed robbers" is not far wrong.
The Hope, however, made a good defence, and
forced the privateer to call for quarter. Under
the existing law, Bainbridge could not claim her
as lawful prize, but was forced to let her go,
shouting out to her commander as they parted,
"Tell your employers if they have occasion for
the Hope, they must send some other man than
you to get her!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>Another time, the Indefatigable, frigate, under
Sir Edward Pellew, afterward Lord Exmouth and
the conqueror of Algiers, sent a squad of seamen
on board the Hope, and took out of her a man
alleged to be a British subject. Bainbridge could
not resist, but he sent word to Sir Edward that
the first British vessel of a force the Hope could
cope with, a man should be taken out of her, as
sure as he was alive and commanded the Hope.
This he did within a week, and carried the man
back to the United States with him.</p>

<p>Things reached such a pass in 1798 that the
necessity for a navy became pressing, and steps
were promptly taken to organize and equip a
naval force. Bainbridge, then twenty-four years
old, was among the first to apply for a commission,
and he was given that of lieutenant commandant.
He soon got the command of a little
cruiser of fourteen guns, captured from the
French, and renamed the Retaliation. The ship
was ordered to the West Indies, to cruise in
company with the Montezuma, sloop of war, and
the Norfolk, brig. On a November day in 1798,
while cruising off <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gaudeloupe'">Guadeloupe</ins>, Bainbridge found
himself too near two French frigates, Le Volontier,
forty-four guns, and L'Insurgente, forty
guns.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> L'Insurgente was a tremendously fast
frigate, and soon overhauled Bainbridge and compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>him to strike his colors. He was at once
taken on board Le Volontier, while L'Insurgente
proceeded in chase of the Montezuma and the
Norfolk. Captain St. Laurent, of Le Volontier,
seeing L'Insurgente about to engage two adversaries,
and knowing her captain, Barreault, to be
a man brave to rashness, was disturbed at the
prospect. He asked Bainbridge, who was on the
quarterdeck, what the force of the American
ships was. Bainbridge promptly replied that the
Montezuma carried twenty-eight long guns, and
the Norfolk twenty. This was about double their
real force. Captain St. Laurent at once signalled
L'Insurgente to return. Her captain, Barreault,
was deeply chagrined, and when he went on board
Le Volontier, told Captain St. Laurent that the
American vessels were of trifling force, and he
could easily have taken them both. Then Bainbridge's
clever <em>ruse</em> was discovered; but the
French officers, realizing that he had done his
duty in trying to save his country's ships, showed
no ill-will toward him.</p>

<p>The Retaliation was the first and only ship
of war captured by the French during the years
that war existed between the United States and
France, although it never was declared. But
Bainbridge's reputation did not suffer by this,
as his whole conduct was that of a man of spirit
and capacity. He rose to the rank of captain
just as he reached his twenty-sixth birthday; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>in 1800 he was appointed to the command of
the George Washington, of twenty-eight guns.
His first duty was to carry tribute to the Dey of
Algiers. No more hateful service could have been
devised for him, and great blame rests upon the
men in the government who subjected the United
States to such humiliation.</p>

<p>In September, 1800, Bainbridge reached Algiers,
and anchored within the mole. Scarcely
had he landed the tribute, consisting of about
half a million in money,&mdash;enough to have built
a ship that could have knocked the Dey's forts
about his ears,&mdash;when he was asked to carry the
Dey's ambassador to Constantinople, along with
a present to the Sultan, of slaves, wild beasts,
and a large sum of money. Bainbridge was
furious at the demand; but the Dey insolently
told him that he must go, or the ship, which was
completely in the Dey's power, would be taken,
her officers and crew sold into slavery, and war
made on American trade. Bainbridge was reminded
that British, French, and Spanish ships
had performed the same duty; but no doubt Bainbridge
realized that in all those cases it was done
from political motives, while in his case it was
done simply because he could not help himself.
With a very bad grace, he agreed, and the presents
and passengers were put in the ship and he
sailed for Constantinople in October. It was a
cruise the officers of the George Washington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>never liked to speak of; but there is no doubt
that, although it was a time of the utmost vexation
and mortification, innumerable amusing incidents
occurred. The Mohammedans had great
difficulty in keeping their faces toward Mecca
during the frequent evolutions of the ship, and
a man had to be stationed at the compass to let
them know when it was time for them to "go
about." This was a standing cause of laughter
and gibes from the sailors, which naturally gave
great offence to the Mohammedans; and these
disagreements, together with a ship full of wild
beasts, made it a cruise never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Bainbridge was very doubtful whether his vessel
would be allowed to pass the Dardanelles, as the
American flag had never been seen in those seas
before; so he concluded to get through by his
wits. He approached with a strong wind, and
clewed up his light sails as if about to anchor,
saluting meanwhile. The salute was returned,
and under cover of the smoke sail was quickly
made and the ship slipped past, out of range of
shot from the castles. When she reached Constantinople,
a boat was sent ashore to report her
arrival. The Turkish officials sent back word
that they knew no such nation as the United
States. They were soon convinced that there
was such a nation, and were well received. The
Sultan's brother-in-law, Capudan Pasha, became
much attached to Bainbridge, and mentioned that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>the Dey of Algiers was not in favour with the
Sublime Porte. Bainbridge, knowing he would return
to Algiers, got a letter from Capudan Pasha,
in which the Dey was commanded to treat the
American commander with the highest respect.
Bainbridge returned to Algiers in January, and
was immediately met with another demand,&mdash;that
he take the Algerine ambassador back to
Constantinople. This he firmly refused, at an
interview in which the Dey stormed, raged, and
threatened. In the midst of this, Bainbridge
calmly produced Capudan Pasha's letter. The
Dey paused, grew pale, and trembled, and then
burst into profuse offers of assistance, which
Bainbridge coolly declined, and left the palace.</p>

<p>The next day, in obedience to orders from
Constantinople, the Dey declared war against
France, and notified all of the French in Algiers&mdash;fifty-six
men, women, and children&mdash;that unless
they left within forty-eight hours, they would be
sold into slavery. France was then at war with
the United States, but this did not prevent Bainbridge
from offering these unfortunates an asylum
on the George Washington at great inconvenience
to himself, and carrying them all to Spain. For
this humane act he received the personal thanks
of Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul.</p>

<p>Bainbridge returned to the United States with
the George Washington, and soon after got the
Essex, a thirty-two-gun frigate attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>squadron which was sent to the Mediterranean
in 1801, under the command of Commodore
Richard Dale. Among the lieutenants of the
Essex was Stephen Decatur, afterward the celebrated
Commodore.</p>

<p>The ship arrived at Barcelona in August, and
took a berth in the harbor, close to the Spanish
guardship. The neatness of the Essex and the
seamanlike appearance and conduct of her officers
and men were so much remarked upon that it
gave great offence to the officers of the guardship.
The stay of the American frigate at Barcelona
was a long scene of turmoil, owing to collisions
between her junior officers and the Spanish midshipmen.
In one of these Decatur figured prominently.
Bainbridge acted with spirit and also
with judgment, but was glad to get away from
such uncomfortable quarters.</p>

<p>By that time Congress was beginning to wake
up to the necessity for a more vigorous policy with
regard to the Barbary powers, and the squadron
was directed to protect American shipping by
force. The corsairs interpreted this to mean
war, and their aggressions reached such a pitch,
after the return of Dale's squadron in 1802, that
in 1803 Commodore Preble was sent out with the
Constitution, the Philadelphia, and five smaller
vessels, to reduce these piratical powers. Bainbridge
was promoted from the command of the
Essex to the Philadelphia, a fine thirty-eight-gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>frigate, carrying a few more than three hundred
men.</p>

<p>Her first lieutenant was David Porter, who,
as a young midshipman, had distinguished himself
in the Constellation under Captain Truxtun,
and who was destined to a highly honorable and
active career during the whole time of his service
in the navy.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia arrived at Gibraltar in August,
1803, and the next day began to cruise up
and down the straits in search of corsairs. In a
day or two she fell in with a Moorish vessel,
the Meshboha, in company with an American
brig which had been captured, and her company
taken aboard the Meshboha. The Philadelphia
stood by, and forced the Moorish captain, Lubarez,
to send all his prisoners to the Philadelphia,
and to come aboard himself. Bainbridge invited
him into the cabin, and feeling sure that he had
orders to capture American ships, directed him to
produce these orders. Lubarez stoutly denied
he had any such orders.</p>

<p>"Very well," coolly responded Bainbridge,
taking out his watch. "I am now going on
deck for half an hour. When I return, if you
cannot show your orders, I will immediately hang
you at the yardarm for a pirate."</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour Bainbridge returned.
Lubarez then sullenly admitted he had
orders, but they were inside his waistcoat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>"Take off your waistcoat," said Bainbridge.</p>

<p>Lubarez began slowly to remove his waistcoat;
but another appeared under it. He finally peeled
off five waistcoats, and underneath the last one
were the orders. Bainbridge immediately took
possession of the Meshboha and her prize, and
carried them both into Gibraltar.</p>

<p>In a few days Commodore Preble reached Gibraltar,
and Bainbridge was sent to Tripoli, with
orders to intercept and capture every Tripolitan
vessel possible. He arrived before Tripoli, in the
autumn of 1803, and immediately began a vigorous
blockade. On the 31st of October he gave
chase to a xebec trying to get into the harbor.
He was rapidly overhauling her, when, at the
mouth of the harbor, the water suddenly shoaled,
and the Philadelphia ran upon a tremendous reef,
known to the Tripolitans, but not down on any
chart.</p>

<p>At once every effort was made to get the ship
off, but she held fast, and soon heeled over so far
to starboard that her guns on that side became
useless. The Tripolitans at once saw her desperate
plight, and gunboats came out in swarms to
attack her. The Americans fought the gunboats
off as best they could, meanwhile working
with amazing energy to save the ship. All the
water in her was pumped out, the anchors were
cut from the bows, most of her guns thrown overboard,
and at last the foremast was cut away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Still the ship stuck fast. Bainbridge, who had
shown great coolness and determination in the
dreadful circumstances in which he found himself,
presently saw that he must give up the ship. He
called a council of his officers, and they agreed
that all had been done that men could do. The
carpenters were ordered to scuttle the ship; and
just as the autumn night was closing in, the
Philadelphia's colors were hauled down, and
the Tripolitans swarmed over the decks, in the
ports, and everywhere a foot could be set. Then
looting began; the officers being robbed of everything,
even their swords and epaulets. Bainbridge
gave up his watch and money in dignified
silence; but when his wife's picture was about to
be torn from around his neck, he swore no man
should have it, and fought the Tripolitan off who
would have taken it.</p>

<p>The officers and men were then carried into
the town, where the officers were received by the
Bashaw in great state, surrounded by his ministers.
It is said that Bainbridge never looked
handsomer or more imposing than when he appeared
at the head of his officers before the
barbaric prince. The Bashaw treated them with
Eastern courtesy, gave them a handsome supper,
for they were half dead with hunger and fatigue,
and then sent them to a temporary prison. They
were in charge of Sidi Mohammed D'Ghies, one
of the great officers of state, who proved to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>man of good heart, and whose ideas of military
honor were Western rather than Eastern.</p>

<p>Then began a captivity which lasted for nineteen
months. The men were reduced to a position
of slavery, and made to work for their
Tripolitan masters. The officers were closely
confined, and after several attempts at escape
had been made by the younger ones, they were
removed to the dungeons of the Bashaw's castle.</p>

<p>The situation of Bainbridge was sad in the
extreme. He felt himself to be foredoomed to
misfortune. He had lost his first ship, the Retaliation,
in the French war. His cruise in the
George Washington had been painful and humiliating
in many respects; and now he had
lost one of the two frigates that the country
depended upon to punish the corsairs. A very
affecting letter of his to his wife exists, in which
he seems plunged into despair; and in it he says
he sometimes thinks "it would have been a merciful
dispensation of Providence if my head had
been shot off while our vessel lay rolling upon
the rocks." But from this sharp affliction his
gallant spirit rallied after a time. His officers
and men felt undiminished confidence in and
affection for him, and did all in their power
to comfort him.</p>

<p>The very day after their capture they sent him
a letter saying, "We, late officers of the United
States frigate Philadelphia, wishing to express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>our full approbation of your conduct concerning
the unfortunate event of yesterday, do conceive
that the charts and soundings justified as near an
approach to the shore as we made, and that after
she struck every expedient was used to get her
off and to defend her which courage and abilities
could dictate.</p>

<p>"We wish to add that in this instance as in
every other, since we have had the honor of being
under your command, the officers and seamen
have always appreciated your distinguished conduct.
Believe us, sir, that our misfortunes and
sorrows are entirely absorbed in our sympathy
for you. We are, sir, with sentiments of the
highest and most sincere respect, your friends
and fellow sufferers."</p>

<p>Here follow the signatures of every officer
under Bainbridge.</p>

<p>He soon received letters from Commodore
Preble; and the brotherly kindness expressed
in them reflects the greatest honor upon a superior
officer who could feel so generously in an
affair which crippled and embarrassed him so
cruelly as the loss of the Philadelphia. Preble
wrote: "May God bless and preserve you! Recollect
that destiny, not want of courage, has deprived
you of liberty, <em>but not of honor</em>." And he
adds, "The first consul of France, the celebrated
Bonaparte, has interested himself deeply in your
situation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>To the chagrin of the Americans, they found
that the Philadelphia had not been thoroughly
scuttled, and she was hauled off the rocks by the
Tripolitans, the holes in her bottom stopped, her
foremast refitted, her guns and anchors fished up,
and she was towed within the harbor. From the
one window of their underground prison, the unfortunate
officers of the Philadelphia could see the
ship riding at anchor, and disgraced by the pirate
flag of Tripoli.</p>

<p>The captives were allowed to communicate at
intervals with Commodore Preble, who gave them
assurance that they were not forgotten, and that
the Bashaw would have to surrender them and
pay dearly for having imprisoned them. Besides
these official communications, means were found
by which letters written in lemon juice were
exchanged, and in one of these Bainbridge suggested
the possibility of destroying the Philadelphia
at her moorings,&mdash;which was afterward
carried out with splendid dash by Decatur.</p>

<p>In spite of those alleviations, there were long
months of weariness and dreariness in a peculiarly
trying captivity. The time was not wholly
wasted. The midshipmen, whose untamed spirits
frequently got them into difficulties, were set to
work by the older officers, and all, men as well as
officers, bore their imprisonment with fortitude.
The seamen were made to labor on the fortifications;
and as they were often unruly, the slave-drivers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>had no hesitation in ordering them to be
bastinadoed on every occasion. The man who administered
the punishment was not so hard-hearted
as his masters, and although he regularly laid on
the required number of blows upon the soles of
the sailors' feet, he winked at the fact that they
had wrapped folds of matting around their feet,
and the blows hurt not at all. The sailors were
clever enough to shriek and scream during this
mock bastinadoing, and the slave-drivers were
completely deceived by Jack's ruse.</p>

<p>At last, on the night of the 15th of February,
1804, the captives were awakened by the firing of
heavy guns. By the light of a brilliant moon and
the blazing hull and spars of the Philadelphia out
in the harbor, they saw the destruction of the ship
by Decatur<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and his gallant band. While they
watched her burn to the water's edge, her shotted
guns burst with heat and flame, her magazine
blew up, and when the sun rose next morning,
not a vestige remained of the lovely frigate. She
had been destroyed by the Americans under Decatur,
without the loss of a single man.</p>

<p>This gave heart to the prisoners, and they felt
their deliverance was at hand; but it was not
until the spring had passed and the summer
dragged along into August that one day they
were roused by a heavy cannonade. They were
then confined underground in the Bashaw's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>castle, and there was only one window by which
they could see the offing. They eagerly clambered
up, and the thrill of joy they felt may be
imagined when they saw a smart flotilla of small
vessels, led with the greatest dash and impetuosity
by Decatur and Somers, burning, sinking, or driving
back the Tripolitan gunboats. And farther
out in the offing, they saw the glorious Constitution
coming into action in grand style, choosing
her range with majestic deliberation, and then
her batteries roaring out destruction to her enemies,
while the Tripolitan shot fell short, or
dropped harmlessly against her stout sides.</p>

<p>For six weeks the attack was kept up furiously,
and in that time five tremendous assaults were
made by Commodore Preble's squadron. In one
of these destructive cannonades a round shot
from the Constitution tore in at the one window
from which a part of the harbor could be
seen, and, narrowly missing Bainbridge, knocked
him down and almost covered him with the mass
of stone and mortar it dislodged. But Bainbridge
was not the man to mind a trifle like this,
and every time the Constitution came within
range, she was welcome to the tired eyes, and the
thunder of her well-served batteries was music
to the ears of the imprisoned Americans. They
hoped from day to day for release, and although
the season for active operations closed before the
Bashaw had actually been reduced to submission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>yet it was plain that the town could not withstand
another such cannonade.</p>

<p>When the Constitution was forced to depart,
she left behind her a menacing promise to the
Bashaw that she would come back the next season,
and finish the work; and the last of May,
1805, saw her again off the town. This time
the Bashaw was anxious to make peace. Sidi
Mohammed D'Ghies urged him to send Bainbridge
aboard the Constitution on his parole, to
see what the Americans demanded. The Bashaw
asked if Sidi really thought that Bainbridge
would return if once his foot touched the Constitution's
deck.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Sidi; "the American
captain will keep his word, and I will leave my
eldest son as a hostage that he will return."</p>

<p>The Bashaw, only half believing, allowed Bainbridge
to go, and on the 1st of June, 1805, nineteen
months exactly after his capture, Bainbridge
again trod the deck of an American man-of-war.
Commodore Rodgers, commanding the Constitution,
and all the officers of the squadron received
him affectionately. They had brought out
a treaty of peace for the Bashaw to sign, and
the first stipulation was that every American
prisoner should be given up immediately and
without conditions. This, Bainbridge said, he
did not believe the Bashaw would ever agree to,
as it was a fixed principle with the Barbary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>powers never to give up a prisoner without ransom.
Bainbridge returned to the shore at nightfall,
and, with Sidi, went to the castle, where the
Bashaw expressed great surprise at seeing him
again. The Bashaw, however, was far less inclined
to keep up the fight than Bainbridge imagined.
After a day or two of hesitation, a council
of war was held at which Bainbridge was invited
to be present,&mdash;an honor never before bestowed
upon a prisoner of the Barbary States. When
Bainbridge entered the council chamber at the
castle, he found the Bashaw surrounded by all of
his great officers of state, with the treaty brought
by Commodore Rodgers spread out before them.
To sign it meant peace, and the immediate release
of every American prisoner; to refuse it meant
that the Constitution and her consorts lying
out within gunshot of the town, would be thundering
at their forts and ships within an hour.
The question of peace or war was debated with
grave eloquence. The council was evenly divided.
At last the decision had to be made. The Bashaw,
after a solemn pause, took his signet ring from
his bosom, and, affixing it to the treaty, said with
dignity,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is peace."</p>

<p>Bainbridge is said to have thought, after the
event happened, that the Bashaw had no real
intention of withstanding another bombardment,
and his hesitation and final yielding to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>advocates of peace was a preconcerted arrangement.</p>

<p>As soon as the treaty was signed, the forts and
castle saluted the American flag, and the squadron
returned the salute. Next day the American
prisoners were released. A Neapolitan who had
been held in slavery for years by the Tripolitans
had been very kind to the sailors and marines,
and they asked Bainbridge if he would authorize
the purser to advance them seven hundred dollars
out of their pay to buy the Neapolitan's freedom.
This was done, and the man was restored to his
country by these grateful men.</p>

<p>The squadron sailed for Syracuse, where a court
of inquiry into the loss of the Philadelphia was
held, and Bainbridge was honorably acquitted.
On his return to the United States he was received
with much kindness by his companions in
arms, by the government, and the people, all of
whom regarded him as a brave and capable officer
who had lost his ship by one of those fateful
accidents against which neither courage nor capacity
can prevail.</p>

<p>It seems singular that on the heels of the splendid
successes of the navy before Tripoli and with
the rest of the Barbary powers, the government
and the people showed very little understanding
of the value of the naval service. As soon as
hostilities were over with the corsairs, a reduction
of the navy took place, although at that very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>time aggressions of Great Britain upon American
merchant ships were continuing at a rate which
was bound to provoke war in the end. Bainbridge,
like many others, found himself without
a ship, and on half-pay; and he asked and obtained
leave, during the intervals when he was
without a naval command, to make voyages in
the merchant service. He was absent on one
of these voyages for profit in the autumn of
1811, when at St. Petersburg he heard of the
probability of a declaration of war with Great
Britain. He started instantly on his return to
the United States, and reached Washington in
February, 1812. He found there one of Commodore
Preble's captains, Charles Stewart,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and to
his rage and mortification was told that the government
thought it vain and foolhardy to give
battle on the sea to the mightiest naval power
on earth, which had then vanquished the navies
of Europe and kept them skulking in their own
harbors. Such over-prudence ill suited the ardent
and determined natures of Bainbridge and Stewart.
They heard that the government had concluded
to lay up such ships as it had, and to prosecute
the fight entirely on land. They went together
to President Madison, and besought him to change
this cowardly and unwise policy, and succeeded
in persuading him to do it. For this one act the
country is forever indebted to Bainbridge and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Stewart. While nothing could eventually stop
the progress of the United States toward being
a great and powerful nation, yet, had it not been
for the victories gained at sea during the War of
1812-15, the dignity and prestige of the United
States would have suffered an eclipse for fifty
years. The success of the Americans in the ship
duels on the ocean during the war of 1812 did more
to make the United States respected abroad than
any event of our history after the Revolution.
The great question of the right of search in neutral
vessels was settled by the achievements of a
few smart vessels with great and daring captains,
belonging to a young and hitherto feeble power in
America,&mdash;a right which had been vainly contested
by all the powers of Europe. The British
navy had been for more than a hundred years
practically invincible, and there can be no doubt
that many of its earlier losses in 1812-15 came
from absolute rashness, fostered by a long and
glorious career of conquest. What was of more
value to the United States than the respect of
continental Europe was the respect earned from
the English themselves. The United States of
1812 was chiefly populated by those only a few
generations from an English ancestry, and the
people of the two countries were alike in their
willingness to make a square, stand-up fight, and
then to shake hands afterward. From the hour
that the first British frigate struck to an American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>ship, the British navy highly esteemed the
American navy, and the British government realized
that at last there was a sea power equal in
skill, daring, and resource to Great Britain. The
ships lost by the British were scarcely missed
from their huge fleets; but Great Britain, like
America, promptly recognized the new and tremendous
force which the taking of those few
ships implied. It was one of the most fortunate
hours that ever dawned for the United States
when the advice of Bainbridge and Stewart was
taken, and within six months they were amply
justified.</p>

<p>Bainbridge by his rank was entitled to a choice
of the few frigates the country then owned, and
he would undoubtedly have chosen the glorious
"Old Ironsides" upon which to hoist his flag.
But Hull<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> had got her already, and, apprehending
that orders might come detaching him, he put
to sea in a hurry, and before he returned, had
captured the Guerrière frigate. Bainbridge got
the Constellation, the fine frigate in which Commodore
Truxtun had fought two French frigates.
He was not able, however, to get to sea in her;
and when Hull returned from his victorious cruise,
in August, 1812, he gave up the Constitution to
Bainbridge, who hoisted a broad pennant on her.
The Essex, thirty-two guns, commanded by Captain
Porter, who afterward made his celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>cruise in her to the Pacific, and the Hornet, of
eighteen guns, under the gallant Lawrence,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with
the Constitution, were ordered to join Bainbridge.
Porter was Bainbridge's old lieutenant in the
Philadelphia, and had shared his captivity at
Tripoli. Events, however, so fell out that the
Essex did not join the other two ships, and Bainbridge
sailed in October, 1812, for the South
Atlantic accompanied only by the Hornet. The
Constitution was in need of repairs, and not sailing
in her usual great form, but could still sail
fairly well on a wind. She had some of the officers
and all of the crew in her that had got her
out of the clutches of Admiral Broke's squadron
in June, and had taken the Guerrière in August.
Therefore it was with great confidence that Commodore
Bainbridge on the morning of the 29th of
December, 1812, made for a British frigate which
showed an equal inclination to close with him.
This vessel, the Java, which carried forty-nine
guns, was undoubtedly a lighter ship than the
Constitution. Yet the British were in the habit
of engaging such odds successfully with the warships
of other nations, and Captain Lambert of
the Java showed a stern determination to stand
by his colors, and was as far from declining the
fight when he saw his adversary's power as when
she was still hull down in the distance.</p>

<p>The Java was fitted out to carry Lieutenant-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Hislop and a large staff to Bombay,
besides a number of naval officers and seamen for
ships on the East India stations. She had about
four hundred and twenty-five men on board.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the day, after man&oelig;uvring
for an hour or two in order to get together, the
first broadsides were exchanged. There was a
light wind blowing, and Bainbridge, wishing to
get the advantage of it as far as possible, did not
strip his ship of much of her canvas, but went
into action with most of his light sails set and his
royal yards across. The Java, which was finely
officered and extra manned, was very actively
handled; and so many evolutions were made, in
order to get a good position for raking, that the
battle ended many miles to leeward of where it
began. The cannonade was brisk from the start,
and soon after the first broadside Commodore
Bainbridge was struck on the hip by a musket
ball, and in less than five minutes, while he was
standing near the wheel, a shot shivered it, and a
small bolt was driven into his thigh. Bainbridge
did not leave the deck a moment for this, but
remained walking about as if he had not been
wounded. The loss of the Constitution's wheel
was very serious, especially with so expert an
antagonist as Captain Lambert to deal with, and
Bainbridge endeavored to close. This was only
partially successful, but nevertheless so effective
was the Constitution's fire that it was soon apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>that she had the Java at her mercy. The
gallant frigate, however, did not strike her colors
until every spar was shot out of her, her captain
mortally hurt, her first lieutenant painfully
wounded, and she had lost forty-eight killed and
one hundred and two wounded. Then only she
hauled down the union jack which had been flying
at the stump of the mizzen-mast. The Constitution
had lost nine men killed and twenty-five
wounded, and came out of the action with all her
royal yards across, and every spar in place.</p>

<p>The Java had been so much cut up that it
was impossible to refit her, and Bainbridge was
forced to burn her, after taking out her wheel to
replace the Constitution's. This was a remarkably
clumsy wheel, and in no way matched the
handsome fittings of the ship; but it was retained,
from motives of sentiment, ever afterward.</p>

<p>Captain Lambert lived several days after the
fight, and was put ashore, with the rest of the
officers of the Java, at San Salvador. Commodore
Bainbridge's wounds were dangerous, as
he had remained on deck from the time he was
shot, at half past two in the day, until eleven
o'clock that night. When Captain Lambert was
about to be taken ashore, Bainbridge had himself
carried on deck by two of his officers, to where
Captain Lambert lay in his cot. Bainbridge, who
was then dangerously ill and in great pain, returned
the dying officer his sword, and Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Lambert, still conscious, feebly thanked him.
The interview brought tears to the eyes of all
who witnessed it, and the two captains parted,
never to meet again in this world, with feelings
of kindness such as brave enemies should entertain
for each other.</p>

<p>Bainbridge treated all of his prisoners with
great generosity, and they showed a very grateful
appreciation of it. On the 4th of January,
on being informed by Lieutenant Chads, next
in command, of Captain Lambert's death, Bainbridge
wrote a very beautiful letter, in which he
said: "Commodore Bainbridge takes this occasion
to observe, in justice to Lieutenant Chads,
who fought the Java after Captain Lambert was
wounded, that he had done everything which a
brave and skilful officer could do, and further
resistance would have been a wanton effusion of
human blood."</p>

<p>This was valuable testimony to Lieutenant
Chads on his future court martial. Bainbridge
had known what it was to lose his ship, and he
could feel for an officer under a similar misfortune.
So thoughtful was his kindness to his prisoners,
that General Hislop in gratitude gave him a
splendid gold-hilted sword, and the two remained
friends and correspondents during the rest of their
lives. The conduct of Bainbridge and his officers
was duly reported in England, and the Prince Regent,
afterward George the Fourth, who could say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>graceful things, remarked that he would like to
shake hands with Bainbridge, for his magnanimity
to the British prisoners. The loss of the
Java, following upon that of the Guerrière and
the Macedonian, produced a shock of pain and
grief throughout Great Britain. The venerable
Admiral Jarvis, the day after the news reached
London, said he had passed a sleepless night, not
from the destruction of a single British frigate, but
because of the seamanlike manner in which it had
been captured, which gave him as an Englishman
much uneasiness and apprehension of the future
naval greatness of the United States. Bainbridge
returned to the United States within five months
of leaving home, and was welcomed as victorious
captains always are. He landed at Boston, where
he was given a splendid public dinner; resolutions
of thanks from the city and State governments
were passed in his honor, and he and the brave
fellows under him became the heroes of the hour.
Amid all this popular adoration, Bainbridge did
not forget the claims of the seamen, and immediately
began efforts to get them prize money.
He wrote, with much justice, that the captain
usually got all the honor when a ship was captured,
while the officers and men, who did quite
as much toward success, got nothing, except from
the generosity of the government; and he was
deeply gratified when Congress, after awarding
him the customary gold medal, and the officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>silver medals, gave the crew a substantial sum
in prize money. He gave up the Constitution
to Captain Stewart, who, like Hull and himself,
was destined to do great things in her.</p>

<p>Bainbridge did not get to sea again during the
war, but soon after the peace he went to the
Mediterranean in command of a splendid squadron
destined to punish the Dey of Algiers for
certain treacherous acts toward American vessels.
Bainbridge hoisted his flag on the Independence,
seventy-four guns,&mdash;the first line-of-battle
ship over which the American flag ever
floated. Decatur, who had sailed in advance of
the commander-in-chief, had already brought the
Dey to terms before Bainbridge arrived, but it
was thought well to show the squadron for some
time in European waters. It consisted of the
largest naval force that had, up to that time, ever
been collected under an American flag officer.
It consisted of one ship of the line, three splendid
frigates, and fourteen smaller vessels, all well
officered and manned, and fine ships of their
class. At Gibraltar, where it lay some time, it
was extremely admired, and the American officers
received much attention from the officers of the
British fleet and garrison.</p>

<p>In 1820 Bainbridge again took a noble fleet to
the Mediterranean. On reaching Gibraltar, he
found a very bad state of affairs between the
officers of the American squadron, which rendezvoused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>there, and the British officers of the garrison
and fleet. Misunderstandings, quarrels, and
duels were so frequent that the Governor had taken
upon himself to forbid the American officers from
visiting the town or garrison. He expressed to
Commodore Bainbridge, however, a desire for an
amicable arrangement. Bainbridge at once required
that this prohibition be removed, and
refused to treat until it was withdrawn, which
was done. As the British officers had very great
personal regard for Bainbridge, he was the man
for smoothing down differences while maintaining
the dignity of an American officer. From that
day, American officers have been well treated at
Gibraltar. This was Bainbridge's last cruise, and
afterward his service was in command of different
navy yards. It is said that in the course of
his naval career he moved his family twenty-six
times. His health began to fail after his fifty-fifth
year, but he survived his sixtieth year.
He died at Philadelphia in July, 1833, honored
and admired to an extraordinary degree. His
last words were, as he raised himself from his
bed of death,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me my sword! And call all hands to
board the enemy!"</p>

<h2>EDWARD PREBLE.</h2>


<p>The story of Commodore Preble is, in itself,
not only exciting but amusing; and the gravest
histories of him have not been able to keep the
vagaries of the commodore's celebrated bad temper
in abeyance. Preble was, unquestionably, one of
the very greatest sea officers this country ever
produced; and however ridiculous the outbursts
of his fiery temper might make him, they never
made him contemptible. "The old man has the
best heart, if he has the worst temper, in the
world," was always said of him by the junior
officers who were the victims of his wrath.
Preble seems to have come naturally by his impetuosity.
His father before him, General Preble,
brigadier in the provincial army, was one of the
same sort, and it was commonly said by their
neighbors and friends that "Ned has a good deal
of the brigadier in him." The father and son
were deeply attached to each other, although they
often came in conflict. The last time was when
Edward was about sixteen years old, in 1777.
Men were so scarce, owing to most of them having
enlisted in the continental army, that the old
brigadier set his boys to hoeing potatoes on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>farm near Portland, Maine. Edward had not
worked very long when, throwing away his hoe,
he declared he had no taste for such work, and
walked himself off to the seacoast, where he entered
the first vessel that would take him. The
brigadier did not seem to regard this as wholly
unjustifiable, and, seeing the boy was bent on the
sea, got him a midshipman's commission in the
infant navy of the colonies. In almost his first
engagement Edward was taken prisoner, but was
given his parole at New York. There is in existence
a letter written to him at that time by his
father the brigadier, which shows great affection
for the boy, and the strongest possible desire that
he should conduct himself honorably. The old
man, then over seventy, reminds his son "not to
stain his honor by attempting to escape." And
another recommendation is followed by the utterance
of a great truth which it would be well if
every human being acted upon. It is this: "Be
kind and obliging to all; <em>for no man ever does
a designed injury to another without doing a
greater to himself</em>."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_095b"></a>
<img src="images/i_095b.jpg" width="400" height="116" alt="Edward Preble signature" />
</div>

<p>Before this, an event had occurred which Preble
occasionally alluded to in after life, and which,
marvellous as it seems, must be accepted as true,
for Preble was too close an observer to have been
deceived, and too sensible a man to have assumed
that he saw a thing which he did not really see.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1779 young Preble was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>attached to the Protector, a smart little continental
cruiser, under the command of Captain
Williams, a brave and enterprising commander.
The Protector was lying in one of the bays on
the Maine coast, near the mouth of the Penobscot,
when on a clear, still day a large serpent was seen
lying motionless on the water close to the vessel.
Captain Williams examined it through his spy-glass,
as did every officer on the vessel. Young
Preble was ordered to attack it in a twelve-oared
boat, armed with a swivel. The boat was lowered,
the men armed with cutlasses and boarding-pikes,
and quickly pulled toward the serpent.
The creature raised its head about ten feet above
the surface, and then began to make off to sea.
The boat followed as rapidly as the men could
force it through the water, and the swivel was
fired at the serpent. This had no apparent effect,
except to make the creature get out of the way
the faster. Preble, however, had had a complete
view of it for some time, and said, in his opinion,
it was from one hundred to one hundred and fifty
feet long, and was about as big around as a barrel.
This account must be accepted as exactly true in
every particular, coming from a man like Edward
Preble; and when he says he saw a sea-serpent
from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet
long and as big around as a barrel and got close
enough to fire at it, it must be absolutely true in
every particular. It must be remembered that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Preble died long before sea-serpent stories became
common.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Preble saw much service in the Revolution,
and was the hero of a very daring achievement
not long after his onslaught on the sea-serpent.
He was then serving as first lieutenant on the
Winthrop, a small cruiser. Captain Little, of
the Winthrop, heard there was an armed brig
lying at anchor under the guns of the British
breastworks on the Penobscot. He gave permission
to Preble to cut the brig out, if possible.
It was determined to steal in upon her at night,
and carry her by boarding. On a dark night,
therefore, Preble, with forty men, ran in unperceived,
and the Winthrop got alongside her
enemy. They all wore their white shirts over
their jackets, so that they could tell friends from
foes when once on the British vessel. The officer
of the deck of the British ship mistook the little
Winthrop for a tender of their own, and called
out, "Run aboard!" "I am coming aboard,"
answered Captain Little, as his vessel shot alongside.
Preble, with only fourteen men, leaped on
the brig's deck, when the Winthrop caught a puff
of wind and drifted off. As they passed ahead,
Captain Little called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall I send you some more men?"</p>

<p>"No," coolly answered Preble; "I have too
many already."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>He had then secured the few men on deck, and
soon had possession of the brig. The British
batteries on shore opened fire on him, but Preble
managed to take the vessel out without serious
damage and without losing a man.</p>

<p>At the end of the Revolution the navy practically
ceased to exist, and Preble went into the
merchant service, as so many of the officers were
forced to do. But in 1798, when the quasi war
with France took place, he re-entered the navy,
which had been created anew. He was commissioned
lieutenant in 1798, and was lucky enough
the very next year to get the Essex, frigate of
thirty-two guns. In her he started on what was
then the longest cruise ever made by an American
man-of-war. He went to the Indian Seas, to give
convoy to a valuable fleet of merchant vessels
engaged in the China and India trade, and which
were liable to be attacked by French cruisers.
He had no opportunity to distinguish himself
especially in this duty, although he took care of
the ships and got them all safely to New York.
Soon afterward, the United States and France
having come to terms, Preble went ashore and
remained for two years. His health was bad in
the beginning, but being much improved, in 1803
he reported for duty, and was assigned to the
Constitution, forty-four guns, then preparing for
a Mediterranean cruise.</p>

<p>At that time the relations of the United States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>with the piratical powers of the Barbary coast
were most unsatisfactory. After years of submission
to their exactions,&mdash;a submission which
seems almost incredible now,&mdash;the United States
government determined to do in the end what it
should have done in the beginning. This was to
send a powerful squadron to attack these pirates
of the land as well as the sea, and to force them
to respect the persons and liberties of Americans.
Preble was given the command of this squadron,
with orders to punish Algiers, Morocco, Tunis,
and especially Tripoli, so that it would not soon
be forgotten. He hoisted the broad pennant of a
commodore on the Constitution, and had under
him the Philadelphia, a heavy frigate of thirty-eight
guns, and five small vessels,&mdash;the Enterprise,
Argus, Nautilus, Vixen, and Siren. It was
a remarkable squadron in many ways. The Constitution
was probably the heaviest frigate afloat,
and able to withstand a cannonade as well as
any line-of-battle ship. In Preble she had a commander
worthy of her.</p>

<p>Preble was then about forty years of age, and
his temper had not been sweetened by dyspepsia,
of which he had been a victim for a long time.
The Constitution was destined, under his command,
to win for herself the famous name of
"Old Ironsides" from the way in which her stout
timbers resisted the tremendous cannonade of the
forts and fleets at Tripoli. It was in this splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>cruise, too, that she gained her well-maintained
reputation for being a lucky ship. In all her
great battles she never lost her commanding officer,
nor did any great slaughter ever take place
on her decks, nor was she ever dismasted or
seriously injured by war or weather, nor did she
ever take the ground. Up to this time the Constellation
had been the favorite frigate of the
navy, but, beginning with Preble's great cruise, the
Constitution became, once and for all, the darling
ship, not only of the navy but of the nation.</p>

<p>The only other heavy frigate in the squadron was
the Philadelphia, thirty-eight guns, commanded by
Captain William Bainbridge. Her tragic fate and
the glorious manner in which it was avenged is one
of the immortal incidents of the American navy.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The five small vessels were commanded by
five young men, lieutenants commandant, according
to the rank of the day, of which three&mdash;Hull,
Decatur, and Stewart&mdash;reached the greatest
distinction. Somers, the fourth, had a short
but glorious career. The fifth, Captain Smith,
was a brave and capable officer, but his name has
been overshadowed by the four young captains,
who made a truly extraordinary constellation of
genius. Among the midshipmen in the squadron
were two, Thomas MacDonough and James Lawrence,
who achieved reputations equal to the
three great captains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>In the summer of 1803 the squadron sailed,
as each ship was ready, for Gibraltar, which was
the rendezvous. On the way out, the young
officers on the Constitution had a taste of the
commodore's temper, which was far from pleasing
to them; but they also found out that he had
an excellent heart, and even a strict sense of
justice, as soon as his explosions of wrath were
over. And before very long they discovered
the qualities of promptness, courage, and capacity
which made Commodore Preble a really great
commander. While off Gibraltar, on a dark
night, the Constitution found herself quite close
to a large ship. Preble immediately sent the
men to quarters, for fear the stranger might
be an enemy, and hailing began. The stranger
seemed more anxious to ask questions than to
answer them. This angered the fiery commodore,
and he directed his first lieutenant to say if the
ship did not give her name he would give her a
shot. The stranger called back: "If you give
me a shot, I'll give you a broadside." Preble,
at this, seized the trumpet himself, and, springing
into the mizzen rigging, bawled out: "This
is the United States ship Constitution, forty-four
guns, Commodore Edward Preble. I am
about to hail you for the last time. If you
do not answer, I will give you a broadside.
What ship is that? Blow your matches, boys!"
The answer then came: "This is his Britannic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>Majesty's ship Donegal, razee, of eighty
guns."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," answered Preble, "and
I shall stick by you till morning to make sure of
your character." In a few minutes a boat came
alongside, with an officer, who explained that the
stranger was the Maidstone, frigate, of thirty-eight
guns, and the delay in answering the hails
and the false name given were because the Constitution
had got close so unexpectedly that they
wanted time to get the people to quarters in case
she should prove an enemy. This one incident
is said to have worked a complete revolution in
the feelings of the officers and men toward Preble;
and although he was as stern and strict as ever,
they could not but admire his firmness and cool
courage in an emergency.</p>

<p>Arrived at Gibraltar, Preble met for the first
time his five young captains. Not one was twenty-five
years of age, and none was married. At
the first council of war held aboard the Constitution
there was a universal shyness on their
part when asked their views by the commodore.
The fame of the "old man's" temper and severity
had preceded him, and his boy captains felt no
disposition whatever to either advise him or to
disagree with him. When the council was over,
Preble remained in the cabin, leaning his head
on his hand, and quite overcome with dejection and
depression. To Colonel Lear, an American consul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>then on board, Preble bitterly remarked: "I
have been indiscreet in accepting this command.
Had I known how I was to be supported, I
certainly should have declined it. Government
has sent me here a parcel of schoolboys, to command
all my light craft!"</p>

<p>A year afterward, when the "parcel of schoolboys"
had covered themselves with glory, Colonel
Lear asked the commodore if he remembered this
speech.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," answered the commodore. "But
they turned out to be good schoolboys."</p>

<p>After collecting his squadron at Gibraltar,
Preble, with three vessels, stood for Tangier.
The Emperor of Morocco pretended to be very
friendly with the Americans, and sent them presents
of bullocks, sheep, and vegetables; but
Preble, while treating him with respect, yet kept
his ships cleared for action and the men at quarters
day and night, lest the Moors should show
treachery. On going ashore with some of his
officers to pay a visit of ceremony to the Emperor,
he gave a characteristic order to the commanding
officer of the ship: "If I do not return,
enter into no treaty or negotiation for me, but
open fire at once." On reaching the palace he
was told that the party must leave their side-arms
outside before entering the Emperor's presence.
Preble replied firmly that it was not the
custom of the American navy, and that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>should enter as they were,&mdash;which they did. The
Emperor soon found what sort of a man he had
to deal with, and Preble had no further trouble
with him. A few weeks after the arrival of the
squadron, Preble heard the news of the loss of the
Philadelphia. Nothing better shows the steadfast
and generous nature of the man than the manner
in which he accepted this misfortune. No regrets
were heard from him; no railing accusations
against Bainbridge; but a prompt and determined
grappling with the terrible complication
of having a great part of his force turned against
him; and the most tender consideration for the
feelings as well as the rights of Bainbridge and
his men.</p>

<p>Preble was enabled to provide himself with
bomb-vessels and gunboats by the aid of the
King of Naples, who, like all the other European
sovereigns, wished to see the nest of pirates exterminated.
The first one of the "schoolboys"
to distinguish himself was Decatur,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who, in February,
1804, crept by night into the harbor of
Tripoli, and earned immortality by destroying
the Philadelphia as she swung to her anchors,
in the face of one hundred and nineteen great
guns and nineteen vessels which surrounded her.
The destruction of the Philadelphia not only wiped
away the stain of losing her, in the first instance,
but was of the greatest advantage to Commodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Preble in the bombardment of Tripoli, as the
frigate would have been a formidable addition
to the defence of the town.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1804, his preparations being
made, Commodore Preble sailed for Tripoli, where
he arrived on the 25th of July. He had one
frigate,&mdash;the Constitution,&mdash;three brigs, three
schooners, two bomb-vessels, and six gunboats.
With these he had to reduce an enemy fighting
one hundred and nineteen great guns behind a
circle of forts, with a fleet of a gun-brig, two
schooners, two large galleys, and nineteen gunboats,
all of which could be man&oelig;uvred both inside
the rocky harbor and in the offing.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3d of August the four
hundred officers and men of the Philadelphia,
confined in the dungeons of the Bashaw's castle,
were gladdened by the sight of the American flag
in the offing, and soon the music of the American
guns showed them that their comrades were battling
for them. On that day began a series of
desperate assaults on the forts and war ships of
Tripoli that for splendor and effect have never
been excelled. Preble could fire only thirty
heavy guns at once, while the Tripolitans could
train one hundred and nineteen on the Americans.
During all these bombardments, while the
gunboats, in two divisions, were engaging the
Tripolitan gunboats, running aboard of them,
with hand-to-hand fighting, sinking and burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>them, the mighty Constitution would come into
position with the same steadiness as if she were
working into a friendly roadstead, and, thundering
out her whole broadside at once, would deal
destruction on the forts and vessels. In vain the
Tripolitans would concentrate their fire on her.
Throwing her topsail back, she would move slowly
when they expected her to move fast, and would
carry sail when they expected her to stand still,
and her fire never slackened for an instant. It
was after this first day's bombardment that the
sailors nicknamed her "Old Ironsides." She
and her company seemed to be invulnerable. Escapes
from calamity were many, but accidents
were few. One of the closest shaves was when,
in the midst of the hottest part of the action, a
round shot entered a stern port directly in line
of Preble, and within a few feet of him. It
struck full on a quarterdeck gun, which it
smashed to splinters, that flew about among a
crowd of officers and men, wounding only one,
and that slightly. Had it gone a little farther, it
would have cut Preble in two.</p>

<p>After one of the fiercest of the boat attacks a
collision occurred between Preble and the scarcely
less fiery Decatur, which is one of the most remarkable
that ever occurred in a man-of-war. At
the close of the attack Decatur came on board
the flagship to report. Preble had been watching
him, and fully expected that all of the Tripolitan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>gunboats would be captured. But, after taking
three of them, Decatur found it impossible to
do more. As he stepped on the Constitution's
deck, still wearing the round jacket in which he
fought, his face grimed with powder, and stained
with blood from a slight wound, he said quietly
to Preble: "Well, Commodore, I have brought
you out three of the boats." Preble, suddenly
catching him by the collar with both hands, shook
him violently, and shrieked at him: "Aye, sir,
why did you not bring me more?" The officers
were paralyzed with astonishment at the scene,
and Decatur, who was scarcely less fiery than
Preble, laid his hand upon his dirk. Suddenly
the commodore turned abruptly on his heel and
went below. Decatur immediately ordered his
boat, and declared he would leave the ship at the
instant; but the officers crowded around him
and begged him to wait until the commodore had
cooled down. Just then the orderly appeared,
with a request that he should wait on the commodore
in the cabin. Decatur at first declared
he would not go, but at last was reluctantly persuaded
not to disobey his superior by refusing to
answer a request, which was really an order. At
last he went, sullen and rebellious. He stayed
below a long time, and the officers began to be
afraid that the two had quarrelled worse than
ever. After a while one of them, whose rank entitled
him to seek the commodore, went below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>and tapped softly at the cabin door. He received
no answer, when he quietly opened the door a
little. There sat the young captain and the
commodore close together, and both in tears.
From that day there never were two men who respected
each other more than Preble and Decatur.</p>

<p>For more than a month these terrific assaults
kept up. The Bashaw, who had demanded a
ransom of a thousand dollars each for the Philadelphia's
men, and tribute besides, fell in his
demands; but Preble sent him word that every
American in Tripolitan prisons must and should
be released without the payment of a dollar.
The Tripolitans had little rest, and never knew
the day that the invincible frigate might not be
pounding their forts and ships, while the enterprising
flotilla of gunboats would play havoc
with their own smaller vessels. The Tripolitans
had been considered as unequalled hand-to-hand
fighters; but the work of the Americans on the
night of the destruction of the Philadelphia, and
the irresistible dash with which they grappled
with and boarded the Tripolitan gunboats, disconcerted,
while it did not dismay, their fierce
antagonists.</p>

<p>Sometimes the squadron was blown off, and
sometimes it had to claw off the land, but it
always returned. The loss of the Americans
was small; that of the Tripolitans great. One of
the American gunboats exploded, and a terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>misfortune happened in the loss of the ketch Intrepid<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and her gallant crew. Reinforcements
were promised from the United States, which
did not come in time, and Preble met with all the
dangers and delays that follow the making of
war four thousand miles from home; but he was
the same indomitable commander, feared alike
by his enemies and his friends. On the 10th of
September the President, forty-four guns, and
the Constellation, thirty-eight guns, arrived; the
John Adams had come in some days before. By
one of those strange accidents, so common in the
early days of the navy, Commodore Barron had
been sent out in the President to relieve Commodore
Preble by the government at Washington,
which, in those days of slow communication,
knew nothing of Preble's actions, except that he
was supposed to be bombarding Tripoli. The
season of active operations was over, however, and
nothing could be done until the following summer.
Meanwhile the Bashaw had a very just apprehension
of the return of such determined enemies as
the Americans another year, and gave unmistakable
signs of a willingness to treat. To that he
had been brought by Commodore Preble and his
gallant officers and crews. Knowing the work to
be completed, Preble willingly handed over his
command to Commodore Barron. He had the
pleasure of giving Decatur, then a post captain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>the temporary command of the Constitution. Before
leaving the squadron, he received every testimonial
of respect, and even affection, from the very
men who had so bitterly complained of his severe
discipline and fiery temper. It was said at the
time, that when the squadron first knew him he
had not a friend in it, and when he left it he
had not an enemy. At that day duelling was
common among the privileged classes all over
the western world, especially with army and navy
officers; but so well did Commodore Preble
have his young officers in hand that not a single
duel took place in the squadron as long as he
commanded it.</p>

<p>The younger officers were supplied with an endless
fund of stories about "the old man's" outbursts,
and delighted in telling of one especial
instance which convulsed every officer and man
on the Constitution. A surgeon's mate was
needed on the ship, and a little Sicilian doctor
applied for the place and got it. He asked the
commodore if he must wear uniform. To which
the commodore replied, "Certainly." Some days
afterward the commodore happened to be in the
cabin, wearing his dressing-gown and shaving.
Suddenly a gentleman in uniform was announced.
Now, in those days flag officers wore two epaulets,
the others but one, and the commodore himself
was the only man in the squadron who was
entitled to wear two. But the stranger had on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>two epaulets; besides, a sword, a cocked hat, and
an enormous amount of gold lace.</p>

<p>The commodore surveyed this apparition silently,
puzzled to make out who this imposing
personage was, until, with a smirk, the bedizened
Sicilian announced himself as the new surgeon's
mate. Furious at his presumption in appearing
in such a rig, Preble uttered a howl of rage,
which scared the little doctor so that he fled up
on deck, closely followed by the commodore, his
face covered with lather, and the open razor still
in his hand. The little doctor ran along the deck,
still pursued by the commodore with the razor,
until, reaching the forward end of the ship, the
poor Sicilian sprang overboard and struck out
swimming for the shore, and was never seen on
the ship again.</p>

<p>Preble transferred his flag to the John Adams,
and visited Gibraltar, where he was received
with distinction by the British officers. He had
many friends among them, especially Sir Alexander
Ball, one of Nelson's captains; and the
great Nelson himself knew and admired the services
of the Americans before Tripoli. The
Spaniards and Neapolitans, who had suffered
much from the corsairs, rejoiced at the drubbing
Preble had given them, and at the prospect that
the Americans imprisoned in the Bashaw's castle
would soon be released. The Pope, Pius the
Seventh, said: "This American commodore has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>done more to humble the piratical powers of the
Barbary coast than all the Christian powers of
Europe put together."</p>

<p>Preble sailed for home in December, 1804, and
reached Washington the 4th of March, 1805, the
day of President Jefferson's first inauguration.
The news of his success and the early release
of the Philadelphia's officers and men had preceded
him. Congress passed a vote of thanks to
him and the officers and men under him. President
Jefferson, although of the opposite party in politics
from Preble, offered him the head of the
Navy Department, but it was declined. Preble's
health had steadily grown worse, and soon after
his return to the United States it was seen that
his days were few. He lingered until the summer
of 1807, when at Portland, Maine, near his
birthplace, he passed away, calmly and resignedly.
He left a widow and one child.</p>

<p>Preble was in his forty-seventh year when he
died. He was tall and slight, of gentlemanly
appearance and polished manners. He left behind
him a reputation for great abilities, used
with an eye single to his country's good, and a
character for probity and courage seldom equalled
and never surpassed.</p>

<h2>STEPHEN DECATUR.</h2>


<p>Among the most brilliant and picturesque figures
in American naval history stands Stephen Decatur.
His achievements were of that dashing and splendid
quality which leaves a blaze upon the page of
history; and the greatest of them, the destruction
of the Philadelphia frigate in the harbor of
Tripoli, earned from Lord Nelson the praise of
being "the most bold and daring act of the
age."</p>

<p>Decatur came justly by his genius for the sea.
His father was a captain in the navy of the
United States, and his grandfather had been a
French naval officer. His was no rude struggle
with adversity. The child of gentle people, he
entered the navy in 1797, with every advantage
of education and training. He was then eighteen
years of age,&mdash;old for a midshipman, when boys
entered at thirteen and were often acting lieutenants
at sixteen. Decatur was a handsome man,
tall and well made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_116"></a>
<img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="400" height="499" alt="Stephen Decatur" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Stephen Decatur</span></span>
</div>

<p>Although of a disposition the most generous,
he was always of an impetuous and even domineering
nature. Strict habits of self-control
modified this impetuosity, but to the day of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>death he was subject to gusts of temper whenever
he came across any instance of cruelty or meanness
or oppression.</p>

<p>A famous example of this was shown shortly
before his untimely death. He was then at the
summit of his fame, one of the ranking officers of
the navy, a navy commissioner, and living in
grand style for the times in the city of Washington.
He had a favorite dog, and one day, when
the dog was lying quietly asleep on the doorstep
of Decatur's house, a policeman came along and
wantonly shot the poor creature. Decatur happened
to see the whole affair, and, rushing out,
he gave the policeman then and there a terrific
walloping. The policeman, smarting from the
injury to his dignity as well as the pounding of
his bones, swore out a warrant, and Decatur was
commanded to appear before the Mayor of Washington.
Furious at the turn of affairs, Decatur
flatly refused to obey the constable's summons.
In vain the officer pleaded with him to go quietly.
Decatur would not budge a step. At last the man
brought a posse and proceeded to take him by
force. Decatur would not be guilty of the crime
of resisting the law, but he proposed to let them
get him before the magistrate the best way they
could. He not only would not walk a step, but
lay down on the floor, and, as he was a large and
heavy man, it was a job to lift him up and put him
in a carriage; but at last it was accomplished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>By the time they reached the Mayor's court,
Decatur's temper, never mild, was red hot. He
proceeded to harangue and even to browbeat the
Mayor, who was a very insignificant person compared
with Commodore Decatur. At the first blast,
though, the Mayor proved that he had a spirit of his
own. "Look here, Commodore," said he, "when
you are on the quarterdeck of your ship you command.
I'll have you understand that this courtroom
is my quarterdeck, and I command here, and
if I hear another disrespectful word from you I'll
send you to jail for as long as I please." Decatur,
paralyzed with astonishment, looked at the Mayor
for a long time; then, suddenly bursting into a
shout of laughter, apologized for his behavior and
submitted to be fined for thrashing the policeman.</p>

<p>Such was the man through life,&mdash;daring, generous,
overbearing sometimes, but always responding
to what was just and courageous in others.</p>

<p>Decatur's first cruise was made in the United
States, frigate, forty-four guns, wearing the broad
pennant of Commodore Barry. Charles Stewart,
afterward the celebrated commodore, was one of
the junior lieutenants of the ship, and the heroic
and unfortunate Richard Somers was one of the
midshipmen.</p>

<p>Decatur and Somers had been schoolmates in
Philadelphia, and the association formed there
was cemented into a devoted friendship in the
steerage of the United States. No two natures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>were ever more dissimilar than that of the impetuous
Decatur and the gentle and retiring but
indomitable Somers. From the beginning they
were actuated by a noble professional rivalry; yet
their close and affectionate friendship was that of
brothers, and their devotion to each other has
become a tradition in the navy.</p>

<p>The United States was a splendid frigate, fast
and weatherly, and, from the regularity with
which she made time on her cruises, was known
as "Old Wagoner." Commodore Barry was an
old officer who had done good service in the
Revolution, and when he took command of the
squadron of which "Old Wagoner" was the flagship,
he sailed at once for the West Indies, to
retaliate on the French ships which had preyed
upon American commerce. It was not the good
fortune of the United States to meet a frigate
of equal force, so that her men and their mettle
could be tried, but she did good service in clearing
out the French privateers which infested
those seas. Decatur saw much active cruising,
and gave indications of that dashing courage,
masterly seamanship, and fertile resource which
he developed the instant he got command of a ship.</p>

<p>He made several cruises, reached his lieutenancy,
and was attached to the Essex when she
went under Captain Bainbridge to the Mediterranean,
in 1802. During the troubles the officers
of the Essex had, at Barcelona, with the officers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the Spanish guardship, Decatur was conspicuous.
Having been annoyed and insulted by the Spanish
officers, on his way to and from his ship, he went
aboard the Spaniard, and asked for her commanding
officer. He was absent, and Decatur left this
message, which he shouted out in his tremendous
voice, on the Spanish quarterdeck: "Tell him that
Lieutenant Decatur of the Essex declares him to
be a scoundrelly coward; and if Lieutenant Decatur
meets him ashore, he will cut his ears off!"
A duel in the case was narrowly averted.</p>

<p>At twenty-four Decatur got his first command,
the Argus, one of the two sixteen-gun brigs which
were to assist Commodore Preble in the reduction
of the Barbary powers. This was a heavier
vessel than a young officer of Decatur's rank
was entitled to, and he was given the command
of her only to take her out of the Mediterranean,
where he was to exchange with Isaac
Hull, then a lieutenant commandant, and take
Hull's vessel, the Enterprise, schooner, of twelve
guns. The Enterprise, like the great frigates
Constitution and Constellation, was a favorite
of fortune. She had a glorious record for so
small a vessel, and fought ten spirited actions
during her career, winding up with the capture
of the Boxer in the war of 1812-15. She was
lucky also in escaping many times from superior
force, and had an uninterrupted course of success.
Her good fortune really consisted in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>people who manned her, and the officers who
commanded her,&mdash;of whom Decatur was not the
least distinguished. He had the good fortune to
have as his first lieutenant in the little schooner
James Lawrence, a man after Decatur's own heart,
who was worthy of his ship and his captain.</p>

<p>Decatur was one of the young commanders
who took part in the council of war called by
Commodore Preble at Gibraltar, in the autumn
of 1803, at which the peppery commodore was so
disgusted that he called them "a parcel of schoolboys."
But most of them were shortly destined
to immortality.</p>

<p>After collecting his force, Preble sailed for
Syracuse, that historic city, beautiful in its decay.
The object of the American commander was to
establish a base of supplies, and to get the co-operation
of the King of the Two Sicilies, who
was also at war with the Bashaw of Tripoli. It
was while at Syracuse, in the autumn of 1803,
that the plan to destroy the Philadelphia in the
harbor of Tripoli was determined upon. The
credit of the original idea has been separately
claimed for Preble, Bainbridge, and Decatur;
and the fact probably is that it occurred at practically
the same time to each one of them. Every
one of Preble's dashing young captains desired
the honor of making the attempt, and the fact
that Decatur obtained the distinction is presumptive
proof that he had a share in the first inception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>of the plan. Stewart's claim to a part in
the undertaking was so strong that to him fell
the honor of supporting, in the Siren, Decatur's
proposed attack.</p>

<p>In order to look over the ground, Preble in
the Constitution, accompanied by Decatur in the
Enterprise, sailed for Tripoli, in December, 1803.
Decatur, with his characteristic boldness, offered
to make the attempt with the Enterprise; but
Commodore Preble prudently concluded to use a
ketch, the Meshouda, which Decatur had lately
captured and which was of a build and rig common
in Mediterranean waters.</p>

<p>As Decatur meant to get inside the harbor of
Tripoli by stratagem, it was important to have a
vessel that would not attract attention. The
ketch was fittingly renamed the Intrepid, and
preparations were begun for the desperate adventure
with her.</p>

<p>Decatur was extremely anxious, as was Stewart,
to cut the Philadelphia out; but Commodore
Preble, as bold as they were, but older and more
prudent, saw the insurmountable difficulties in
the way of bringing so large a ship as the Philadelphia
out of a dangerous and unknown harbor
such as Tripoli. He therefore gave strict orders
that no attempt should be made to carry her out,
but that she should be destroyed at her moorings;
and the commodore was certain to be obeyed.</p>

<p>The Intrepid was converted into a fire-ship, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>"infernal." She was filled with combustibles, and
it was designed that she should steal in at night
in disguise, throw the combustibles into the Philadelphia,
fire them, and then make a race for her life.</p>

<p>The nature of this enterprise required men of
extraordinary steadiness as well as courage; but
they could be easily supplied from the American
squadron. It was intended to man and officer
the Intrepid as far as possible from the Enterprise;
and in pursuance of this, on the afternoon
of the 3d of February, 1803, all hands on
the Enterprise were called up and aft. Decatur
then stated the nature of the service for which
the Intrepid was destined,&mdash;a service of heroic
possibilities but appalling danger,&mdash;and then
called for sixty-two volunteers. Instead of sixty-two
men, the whole ship's company down to the
smallest boy volunteered with a cheer. This was
what any captain would have desired, and Decatur
was forced to make a choice. He selected sixty-two
of the youngest and most active men in the
crew, who showed their gratification by saying,
"Thankee, sir," as each man was told off. He
could make no choice among his lieutenants, but
took them all&mdash;Lawrence, Joseph Bainbridge, and
Thorn&mdash;and one of his midshipmen, the indomitable
Macdonough, the rest being necessarily left
to take care of the ship. He was compelled to
make a draft of junior officers from the Constitution,
and asked for midshipmen Morris, Laws,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Izard, Davis, and Rowe. There was also a surgeon,
Dr. Heermann, and Salvatore Catalano, a
Sicilian pilot, who, in return for his services, was
made a master in the American navy, and had an
honorable career in it.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 3d of February the
Intrepid sailed upon her glorious expedition,
accompanied by the Siren, whose character as
a ship of war was thoroughly concealed. The
ketch was to pass for a merchant vessel from
Malta, and her officers had the costumes of Maltese
sailors in which to disguise themselves. The
two vessels reached the entrance to the harbor of
Tripoli on the 9th of February, but a terrific storm
arose, which drove them off. For six days they
were storm-tossed in the gulf of Sydra, but on the
16th of February they found themselves together
again off Tripoli. The evening was mild and
beautiful, and the wind was so light that the
Siren was almost becalmed in the offing, but
the Intrepid met a wandering breeze that carried
her within the rocky harbor. Once inside,
a good breeze was blowing, which swept them
rapidly forward, and threatened to bring the
Intrepid up with the Philadelphia before it was
quite dark enough to do the work meant for her.
As it would not do to excite suspicion by taking
in sail, Decatur had buckets and sails towed astern
which acted as a drag, and brought the ketch in
very slowly. When Decatur noticed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Siren in the offing had no wind and consequently
could be of no assistance to him, he remarked
cheerfully to his men, "Never mind; the fewer
the number the greater the glory."</p>

<p>The ketch sailed leisurely in, having the appearance
of a merchant ship from a Mediterranean
port, after a considerable voyage.</p>

<p>The crew had been sent below, and only a few
officers, disguised as Maltese sailors, stood or sat
about the deck. Before them lay the Bashaw's
castle, with its menacing battlements, and all
around the harbor was a chain of forts that could
make a circle of fire for an invader. Directly
under the guns of the castle loomed the tall black
hull of the Philadelphia, flying the piratical flag of
Tripoli, while moored near her were three smaller
cruisers and nineteen gunboats.</p>

<p>The moon had risen, and by its clear illumination
the "infernal" steered straight across the
blue waters of the harbor for the Philadelphia.
When about two hundred yards off, Salvatore
Catalano, the pilot, hailed the Tripolitan officer
of the deck on the Philadelphia, who lounged
over the rail smoking a long pipe.</p>

<p>"This is the ketch Stella, from Malta," he
said in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lingua franca</i> of the East. "We lost
our anchors and cables in the gale, and would
like to lie by you during the night."</p>

<p>"Your request is unusual, but we will grant
it," answered the Tripolitan officer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>The officer then asked what vessel it was that
was lying in the offing. The pilot, with much
readiness, replied that it was the Transfer, a
cruiser lately bought from the British by the Tripolitan
government, and which was daily expected.
This answer seemed to satisfy the Tripolitan, and
a boat then put off from the Philadelphia with
a fast, and at the same moment a boat also put
off, under the command of Lawrence, from the
Intrepid. On meeting, Lawrence coolly took the
fast from the Tripolitan boat, and soon had
the hawser aboard of the ketch. A moment more
and the supposed Maltese sailors, in their jackets
and red fezzes, roused on the hawser and breasted
the ketch along under the Philadelphia's quarter.
Had the slightest suspicion been aroused
then, they would have been blown out of the
water by a single broadside. But the Americans
retained their coolness in their desperate situation.</p>

<p>Presently the Intrepid drew out from the black
shadow of the frigate's hull into a great patch of
white moonlight. The Tripolitans saw the anchors
on the deck, with the cables coiled around
them. Instantly a cry rang through the ship,
"Americanos! Americanos!"</p>

<p>At the same moment the Intrepid came grinding
up against the frigate's stern quarter, and,
as if by magic, was alive with men. Decatur
shouted, "Board!" and the Americans dashed
at the frigate's deck.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>Decatur, and two midshipmen, Morris and Laws,
leaped at the same moment into the chain plates.
Decatur and Morris made a spring for the rail;
Decatur's foot slipped, else he would have been
first upon the Philadelphia's deck; but Morris,
an agile young midshipman, was a moment before
him. Midshipman Laws dashed at a port, and
would have been before Morris in entering the
ship, but the pistols in his boarding-belt caught
for a moment between the gun and the port, and
he was third to stand upon the deck. The rest of
the Americans swarmed into the ship.</p>

<p>The Tripolitans, completely surprised, yet fought
desperately. They had been accounted the best
hand-to-hand fighters in the world, but they were
no match for the Americans. Within fifteen
minutes every one of them had been cut down
or driven overboard, and the Philadelphia was
once more an American ship. Meanwhile lights
had been moving about on shore, and the vessels
and forts saw that something was happening on
the Philadelphia, but not enough could be seen
to justify them in firing on their own ship. In
a few minutes more, though, smoke was pouring
from the ports, and flames were running up her
tar-soaked rigging. The Americans, with almost
incredible swiftness, had hoisted powder aboard
the ship and fired her in a dozen places. Two
guns, double-shotted, were dragged amidships and
pointed down the main hatch to blow her bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>out. They then leaped into the ketch; but at
that moment the most awful danger of that terrible
yet glorious night awaited them. The fast
became jammed, and the jigger of the ketch
caught fire as it flapped against the burning
frigate, while below, on the Intrepid's deck, lay
all her powder exposed. The officers, undismayed
however, drew their swords and hacked at
the hawser until it parted. Then, under sweeps
and sails, the Intrepid made for the offing, the
men pulling for their lives, while the ships and
forts, now thoroughly aroused, opened all their
batteries on this daring invader. But the shot
fell short, and raised only showers of spray, at
which the Americans laughed and jeered.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia was now ablaze from rail to
truck, and sea and sky were lighted up by the
flames of the burning ship. Her guns began to
go off as the fire reached them, and she poured
a cannonade from every quarter. The ketch was
plainly visible as she made rapidly for the offing,
and a hundred guns were trained on her. At
this supreme moment the Americans gave one
last proof of their contempt of danger. The men
stopped rowing, and every officer and man, rising
to his feet, gave three thundering American cheers.
Then they bent to their oars with giant strokes,
and in a little while were safe under the Siren's
guns. They had not lost a man in the glorious
achievement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>The Siren, meanwhile, in the offing, had hoisted
out her boats, and was ready to assist the Intrepid,
in case she needed it. The progress of
the ketch was plainly visible until she was lost
in the shadow of the Philadelphia's black hull.
In a few minutes a single rocket skyward showed
the anxious watchers that the Philadelphia was
boarded; and almost at once the blaze rushed
up the rigging, and enveloped the tall hull, lighting
up the night with a lurid glare, while the
guns of the doomed frigate and those of the castle,
the ships, and the forts thundered out. Then
they knew that the great enterprise was accomplished.
The boats pulled toward the harbor
entrance; soon the ketch had shot across the
illuminated water, and had reached them. Decatur,
jumping into one of the Siren's boats, was
quickly pulled toward the brig. Stewart, standing
in the gangway, saw the boat approach, and
a man, in a sailor's round jacket and a fez, sprang
over the gangway, into his arms. It was Decatur.</p>

<p>Fifteen days after leaving Syracuse, the ketch
and the brig were seen standing in the harbor,
the signal of success flying from the Intrepid's
masthead. For this splendid adventure Decatur
was made a post-captain, his commission dating
from the 16th of February, and the officers and
men were rewarded.</p>

<p>Before, however, receiving his commission,
Decatur was yet to do glorious things in the bombardment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>of Tripoli during the following summer.
Commodore Preble, in arranging the boat attacks,
which he supported by the batteries of the "Old
Ironsides," and all his brigs and schooners,
gave the command of the right division to Richard
Somers, Decatur's bosom friend, and the left
division to Decatur. On the 2d of August the
first attack was made. The Tripolitans had a
flotilla of fourteen gunboats to resist the six the
Americans could muster; and they had, in reserve,
behind the rocks in the harbor, five more gunboats
and several heavy galleys, besides their
forts, batteries, and larger clubs. The attack was
begun about half past one in the afternoon, the
whole force standing in; the Constitution approaching
as close as possible and pouring in
many broadsides against the forts, the brigs and
schooners supporting the gunboats, while the
latter dashed at the Tripolitan gunboats and galleys
with a swiftness and impetuosity that were
simply tremendous. The attack soon assumed a
character of hand-to-hand fighting that is seldom
seen in modern days. Decatur's own vessel laid
aboard a large Tripolitan gunboat, and in spite of
the most desperate resistance, grappled with her.
She was divided in the middle by a long narrow
hatchway, and in this the Tripolitans mustered
to drive back the Americans when they entered.
Immediately Decatur was over the side, followed
by his lieutenant, Mr. Thorne, by Macdonough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>and all the Americans in the gunboat's crew.
They advanced together with pikes and cutlasses,
and then ensued a contest, man to man, fighting
every inch of the way, which resulted in cutting
down or driving overboard every Tripolitan officer
and man.</p>

<p>Just as the Tripolitan ensign was hauled
down, it was seen that James Decatur, Decatur's
younger brother, who was in command of another
gunboat and had carried her into action with
great spirit, had fallen by a shot from a Tripolitan
which had surrendered and then basely
resumed firing. James Decatur was carried aboard
the Constitution to die, but it was no time to
indulge in private griefs; and Decatur, without
knowing whether his brother were living or dead,
turned upon the next foe. This was another
gun-vessel, which was commanded by a gigantic
Tripolitan, who seemed to court rather than avoid
a hand-to-hand contest with the Americans.</p>

<p>Decatur ran him aboard, and then with a
cheer the Americans leaped into the gunboat.
Seeing the force with which they had to contend,
Decatur waited until his men could form a line.
They then advanced resolutely, led by their officers.
They were greatly outnumbered, but by
standing together they made the most of their
number. The Tripolitan captain and Decatur
soon met face to face. The Tripolitan, a much
larger and more powerful man than Decatur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>stood on tiptoe to deal a more tremendous blow.
Decatur rushed at him with a pike. The Tripolitan
wrenched the pike from him, and raised it to
strike. Decatur then drew his sword, and in
trying to parry the pike, the sword broke off at
the hilt, and the pike entered Decatur's breast.
Pulling it out, he grappled with the Tripolitan,
and both came to the deck together. The
Tripolitan attempted to draw his dagger; but
Decatur, firmly grasping his arm, managed to
get a small pistol from his pocket, and fired it.
With a scream the Tripolitan relinquished his
hold and rolled over. As Decatur rose to his
feet, another Tripolitan raised his sword; as the
blow was about to descend on Decatur's head,
Reuben James, a powerful young sailor, threw up
his arm, and took the blow, which almost severed
his arm from his body. The Americans were
now beginning to get a little the advantage; and
by coolness and resolution they were soon enabled
to get possession of the gunboat. The Tripolitan
loss showed the nature of the fighting, fifty-two
men being killed and wounded out of a total of
eighty in the two captured gunboats. The loss of
the Americans was relatively small, owing to their
plan of standing together and attacking as a body.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Four more of these ferocious attacks, combined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>with a terrific cannonade from the Constitution,
and the assistance from the brigs and
schooners, lost the Tripolitans many of their
most serviceable craft, and made those that were
left very shy of coming outside the reefs to meet
the "Americanos." The great guns on the Constitution
had knocked to pieces many of the
more exposed land batteries, and brought down
the Bashaw's tone immeasurably. He was then
anxious to negotiate, but Commodore Preble
would listen to nothing but the unconditional
surrender of Bainbridge and his men.</p>

<p>The loss of the Americans was small in numbers
but great in value during the bombardment,
and was confined chiefly to the gunboats. In
the second attack, on the 7th of August, one of
the American gunboats blew up, killing her
brave commander, Lieutenant Caldwell, and several
others. When the smoke cleared away
after the awful explosion, it was seen that the
forward part of the vessel still floated. On it
was the long twenty-six-pounder, which was her
chief weapon, and which the gun's crew, directed
by Midshipman Spence, had just loaded. With
as much coolness as if there had been a whole
vessel instead of a half one beneath them, the
gun was fired, the eleven men on the wreck gave
three cheers, led by the midshipman, and then
sprang into the water. All were picked up, and
fought during the rest of the action.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>There was another attack on the 28th of
August, and again on the 3d of September.
In this last the Constitution bore the brunt
of the Tripolitan fire, and did fearful execution
with her heavy guns. And on the 4th of September
occurred the terrible tragedy of the blowing
up of the ketch Intrepid.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The beginning of the autumn marked the end
of the season for active operations, and the American
squadron withdrew, with a promise to return
the next season and do yet more damage,&mdash;a
calamity which the Bashaw avoided by promptly
giving up the American prisoners the next spring,
when the Americans, true to their word, returned
in greater force. A relief squadron which had
been sent out from the United States arrived
just at the close of the campaign before Tripoli.
It brought out Decatur's commission as a post-captain,
as well as lesser promotions for the other
young commanding officers. Commodore Preble,
on being relieved by Commodore Barron, turned
over the Constitution to Decatur, who thus, at
twenty-five, commanded what was probably the
finest frigate in the world. His rank, however,
as the youngest post-captain in the navy did not
entitle him to keep her very long, and he was
transferred to the Congress, a smart thirty-eight-gun
frigate. She was in the squadron of
Commodore Rodgers, which, after the humbling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>of Tripoli, was engaged in bringing the Bey of
Tunis to terms. Commodore Rodgers sent Decatur,
who was well known to the heads of Barbary
powers, to negotiate a treaty with Tunis. The Bey
at first refused to receive him. Decatur returned
to his ship, which was cleared for action, and
sent a message saying that the Bey must decide
at once between war and peace. The Bey
succumbed immediately, and not only begged
for peace, but asked that the Congress should
convey a Tunisian envoy to the United States.
This was rather more than Decatur had bargained
for, particularly as he had to give up a part of his
quarters to the Tunisian envoy and his suite.
But having succeeded rather better than he expected,
Decatur took the party on board and
returned to the United States, reaching home
in 1805.</p>

<p>He was received with praise, admiration, and
the highest personal and official favor. He was
given good commands, and a few years after he
had gone out to the Mediterranean to command
a little twelve-gun schooner, he again went out
in command of a splendid squadron, his broad
pennant flying on the mighty Constitution. He
was sent to demand reparation from the Dey of
Algiers for certain injuries to American citizens.
The American consul went in person to see the
Dey, who sat in state, looking through the open
window at the formidable force with which Decatur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>was prepared to enforce his demands. The
consul began by saying, significantly, that the
squadron was commanded by Commodore Decatur.
The Dey, gravely combing his beard with
a diamond comb, said: "I know this Decatur.
He is the man who burnt the frigate at Tripoli.
Hum! Why do the Americans send wild young
men to treat with old powers?" Nevertheless, he
very promptly gave all the satisfaction demanded
by the "wild young man."</p>

<p>On the outbreak of hostilities with Great
Britain in 1811-12, Decatur got the command
of the United States,&mdash;"Old Wagoner," the
stanch and weatherly frigate in which he had
made his first cruise with his beloved Somers.
In her he made the second capture of a frigate
in that war, Hull having preceded him in the capture
of the Guerrière by the Constitution.</p>

<p>Off Madeira, on the 25th of October, the
United States sighted the Macedonian,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a magnificent
thirty-eight-gun frigate, commanded by
Captain Carden. Decatur and Carden were personal
friends, and before the war broke out
had often discussed the relative fighting powers
of their ships. Decatur's black servant had listened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>to these talks as he stood behind his
master's chair. Captain Carden frequently said,
"No, my dear Decatur. Your men are brave,
but not experienced; and when they meet a
British ship of equal force, with the best intentions
to do their duty, they will not know how
to fight." Cuffee remembered this, and as soon
as it was known on "Old Wagoner" that the
approaching frigate was the Macedonian, he very
prudently retired to the lower hold, and hid behind
a hogshead.</p>

<p>The action began with the greatest spirit on
both sides, the ships keeping up a furious cannonade
at close quarters, with a heavy sea on and a
good breeze blowing. The Americans showed
great superiority in gunnery, and although the
British fought with a gallantry worthy of British
tars, and their officers nobly encouraged
them by word and example, in seventeen minutes
from the time the first broadside struck the
Macedonian all was over, and her colors were
hauled down. She had suffered terribly, more
than a third of her men being killed and wounded.
She lost so many men at the guns that the marines
were called upon to work the batteries. On
the American ship only twelve men were killed
and wounded, and the marines during the whole
battle were drawn up in the waist of the ship,
with nothing to do. This, however, was much
more trying than fighting, as they had to stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>as if they were on parade, while shot and shell
screamed a few inches above their heads. The
men, however, showed the utmost steadiness, and
acted as well as looked as if they were merely at
Sunday morning quarters. When the Macedonian
struck, it was plain from the way she was
cut up that she had made a good and gallant
defence. As Captain Carden came over the side,
he offered his sword to Decatur, who refused to
take it, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot take the sword of a man who has
so bravely defended his ship."</p>

<p>The solemn silence of the occasion was broken
by Cuffee, who, the danger being over, had
crawled up out of the hold, and appeared upon
the quarterdeck at that moment, just in time to
bawl out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Marse Carden, what you think now
'bout de way dem 'Mericans fights!"</p>

<p>It was several weeks before the United States
reached home, and during that time Captain
Carden was Decatur's guest in the cabin. Decatur's
first letter to his wife after the capture
of the Macedonian says: "All my pleasure is
spoiled by poor Carden's sorrow;" for Captain
Carden knew nothing of the previous capture
of the Guerrière and of the Java, which followed
shortly after, and thought himself to be
the first and only English captain who had surrendered
his ship. On reaching the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>States, Decatur and his officers received the
thanks of Congress, and a gold medal for their
gallant conduct.</p>

<p>Decatur had looked forward to another active
cruise in "Old Wagoner," but he soon found himself
penned up at New London by a large blockading
force. Decatur's impetuous nature fretted
and chafed under this, and in 1814, realizing
the impossibility of the United States getting to
sea, he got command of the President, of forty-four
guns, then lying at New York. Decatur
took command of her with bright anticipations.
New York bay was closely watched by British
cruisers, but Decatur had no fears that he should
not be able to get out. Accordingly, on a dark and
stormy night in January, 1814, he picked up his
anchor, and made for the open sea; but before
daylight the pilots had run the frigate aground
near Sandy Hook, where for an hour and a half
she lay pounding on the bar. She got off by the
rising of the tide, but she was so hagged and
twisted that her back was nearly broken, her
masts sprung, and her sailing qualities so impaired
that she stood but a small chance of escape
should she fall in with an enemy. Unable by
reason of the wind to return to New York for
repairs, the President proceeded to sea, and by
daylight found herself surrounded by a British
squadron, consisting of the Majestic, razee, and
the Endymion, of forty guns, and the Tenedos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>and Nymph, light frigates. Then began a fight
as well as a race for life, which lasted thirty
hours. The Endymion got near enough for a
bloody contest, in which she was badly crippled
and left behind, the President making a desperate
though lame attempt at flight from her
antagonists. But it was in vain. The Tenedos
and Nymph gained on her, and it was soon
known to all on board that the President was
a doomed ship. Three of her five lieutenants
lay dead upon her decks, while among the mortally
wounded was Midshipman Richard Dale,
son of the famous Commodore Dale, of Revolutionary
fame. The killed and wounded among
the crew were numerous, and Decatur himself
received a painful injury.</p>

<p>His people, who had never seen him except in
the light of triumph and success, were curious to
observe how he would stand impending defeat.
But never was he calmer and cooler. At one
time, seeing he could handle the Endymion
alone, he formed the desperate plan of boarding
her, transferring his people to her, and abandoning
the President. The proposition was received
with cheers. One of his youngest midshipmen,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
a lad of fourteen, said out aloud, in Decatur's
hearing,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never can get over the side of that ship, as
small as I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can," replied Decatur, smiling.
"I will pick you up and throw you over
myself."</p>

<p>The Endymion, seeing that the President must
be shortly overpowered by the rest of the squadron,
very sensibly refused to close, and fell out
of the chase in a helpless condition, every sail
being shot away from her.</p>

<p>It was now night, and the President hoped
to escape in the darkness, which was extreme.
But about eleven o'clock the Pomone ranged up
under her lee and poured in a broadside, while
the Tenedos was closing in on the weather quarter,
and the Majestic was within gunshot astern.
The President hauled her colors down, and Decatur
offered his sword to Captain Hayes of the
Majestic, the ranking officer present. It was
refused in the same noble words which Decatur
had used toward Captain Carden: "I cannot
accept the sword of a man who has so bravely
defended his ship."</p>

<p>Decatur was taken to Bermuda, where he was
received with the highest distinction by the great
Admiral, Lord Cochrane, and all of the British
officers. At a splendid dinner given him by the
British naval officers, some one was tactless
enough to allude to the capture of the President,
at which Lord Cochrane promptly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The President was mobbed, sir,&mdash;simply
mobbed."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>Decatur and his officers were soon paroled, and
sent home in a special frigate. Peace was declared
a few days after, and at New London,
where Decatur was landed, there was a grand
celebration of the treaty of peace, on the 22d
of February. The British frigate in which he
had been returned took part in the celebration,
and the British and Americans united, as generous
enemies who have become friends should in
observing the glorious occasion.</p>

<p>After the peace, Decatur hoisted his broad pennant
on the Guerrière,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and commanded a fine
squadron in the Mediterranean, where his name
was always a power. On his return from this
cruise he was made one of the three navy
commissioners who were at the head of
the Navy Department in those days. He had
amassed a comfortable fortune, and built a fine
house in Washington, near the White House,
and had apparently entered upon a long career
of peace and prosperity; but it was not to
be.</p>

<p>It is distressing to chronicle the melancholy
end of so glorious a life. In those days duelling
was thought justifiable and even obligatory
on occasions. Decatur lost his life in March,
1820, near Washington, in a duel with Commodore
Barron, concerning some things he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>said about Barron many years before. His
death and the manner of it were universally
deplored, and when the anxious multitude who
surrounded his house in Washington was told
that he was no more, Reuben James, the old
sailor who had once saved Decatur's life at the
risk of his own, cried out, "The navy has lost
its mainmast."</p>

<p>Decatur was the author of that patriotic saying
which is heard from many American lips
and is deeply engraved in every American breast:
"My country, may she always be right; but, right
or wrong, my country!"</p>

<h2>RICHARD SOMERS.</h2>


<p>The name and fame of Richard Somers will
always be of tender and regretful interest. His
gentle and lovable character, his quiet, undaunted
courage, the daring enterprise in which he lost his
life at the early age of twenty-four, all unite in
making him one of those young heroes who are
never forgotten. As he died young, so must he
ever remain, a figure of heroic youth, untouched
by age or time, illumined by a melancholy glory.
Few circumstances of Somers's early life are
known. Of a singularly modest and reserved
nature, he seldom spoke of himself, and beyond
the bare facts of his boyhood and young manhood,
little has been gleaned by his various biographers.
His father was a man of standing and importance,
and represented his district in New Jersey in the
Colonial Congress. Somers Point, opposite Cape
May, was the family property. Richard Somers,
the youngest of his father's children, was born in
Philadelphia in 1779, whither his family had
removed. It is said that his father was a firm
friend and supporter of General Washington from
the beginning of his command of the Continental
army, and that Washington bestowed much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>kindly notice upon the lad, Richard Somers.
Among Somers's possessions was a ring, which he
valued highly, containing the hair of Washington.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_146"></a>
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="400" height="517" alt="Richard Somers" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Richard Somers</span></span>
</div>

<p>The boy went to a "dame's school" in Philadelphia
with Stephen Decatur; and there began
that devoted friendship which lasted through
Somers's brief life. No two natures were ever
more contrasted than Somers and Decatur. Somers
was mild in the extreme, of the gentlest manners,
silent, and somewhat reserved. Decatur was
a young volcano in energy, and pursued all his
objects in life with a fire and impetuosity almost
inconceivable. The affection between the two
seemed to be something deeper and stronger than
brotherhood, and joined with it was a professional
rivalry that only such an affection could have
prevented from becoming enmity.</p>

<p>Somers was left an orphan when a lad not more
than twelve years old. He had, however, an uncle
who was a second father to him, and he inherited
a respectable property. There is no record of
Somers having gone to sea before he received
his appointment as midshipman, of the same date
as Decatur's, 1798. But a number of circumstances
indicate that he was already a capable
seaman when he got his midshipman's warrant
to the United States, frigate of forty-four guns.
He was made master's mate of the hold almost
immediately on joining the ship, a place given
the steadiest and readiest of the midshipmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>and it is assumed that he would not have been
selected had he not known something of his
profession.</p>

<p>The United States, which wore the broad
pennant of Commodore Barry, was engaged in
active cruising in the West Indies during the hostilities
with France in 1799-1801, but never came
to close quarters with a ship of her own size during
the cruise. Somers seems to have won the goodwill
of every one on board, including Commodore
Barry and the future Commodore Stewart, who
was the first lieutenant. Somers's mildness seems
to have been misunderstood for weakness, and on
hearing of some aspersions upon him, Somers
determined, in his cool and deliberate manner, to
show the stuff that was in him. Duelling was
then a common practice among officers of the
army and navy, as well as among all those who
classed themselves as gentlemen. Somers therefore
challenged three of his tormentors among
the midshipmen, and arranged that the three duels
should be fought one immediately after another.
Decatur was to be his second in all these affairs,
and it is a grotesque circumstance that the origin
of the reflections cast on Somers was from the
unresenting way with which he put up with Decatur's
chaff.</p>

<p>In the first two duels Somers received two
slight wounds which prevented him from standing
up. Decatur eagerly insisted upon being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>allowed to take Somers's place after the first
hurt received by Somers; but Somers refused,
and exchanged shots for the third time, sitting
on the ground and held up in the arms of Decatur.
It was the first and last time that his courage
was ever doubted, and his peace-loving and
gentle nature was esteemed at its true value ever
afterward.</p>

<p>In 1801 the United States returned home,
and Somers's next orders were to the Boston,
of twenty-eight guns, in which, at the age of
twenty-two, he found himself in the responsible
situation of first lieutenant. The Boston was
commanded by Captain Daniel McNeill, an old
Revolutionary captain, who was one of the characters
of the old navy. He was a fine seaman
and a man of resolution and integrity, but not
very amenable to authority. The Boston was
ordered to proceed to Europe with Chancellor
Livingston, who was to arrange terms of peace
with France. They encountered heavy weather,
and Captain McNeill carried sail in such a way as
to astonish his young officers; but he had in
his first lieutenant a man almost as well versed
in seamanship as himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps no young officer in the navy of that
day was so well adapted, by his conciliatory and
amiable manners, to be the first lieutenant of
such a man as Captain McNeill. The Boston
had been ordered to report to Commodore Richard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Dale, who was Captain McNeill's senior in rank,
although much his junior in age. But Captain
McNeill seems to have had no notion of putting
himself under the orders of a man so much
younger than himself, and although he cruised
for nearly two years in the Mediterranean, ostensibly
hunting for the flagship, he managed by
the greatest adroitness never to set eyes on
her. He was meanwhile very actively engaged
in his duty, and gave convoy to American vessels,
frightened off the piratical vessels of the Barbary
powers, and even blockaded Tripoli for a time;
but he was always just a little too late or a trifle
too early to join the flagship. The cruise afforded
a multitude of amusing anecdotes about this
doughty but eccentric captain, whose character
and attainments commanded respect, in spite
of his oddities. Once, at Malaga, at a grand
dinner given to Captain McNeill and his officers,
as also to some Swedish officers of high rank, the
American captain was seated between two Swedish
admirals. At nine o'clock a midshipman
entered the room, according to orders, and reported
to Captain McNeill that his boat waited.
"What did you say?" asked the captain. The
midshipman repeated his announcement, Somers
and the other American officers present waiting
in agony for what Captain McNeill would say or
do next. The captain again asked the midshipman
what he said, bawling out, "These bloody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>Swedes keep up such a chattering I can't hear
what you say!"</p>

<p>Another one of Captain McNeill's adventures
was when, lying in a French port, he wished to
test how quickly his ship could be got under way.
Three of his own officers were on shore, but three
French naval officers happened to be on board;
so, coolly remarking that he would hold on to the
French officers to keep up his complement, he put
to sea. It was several months before the Frenchmen
could return to France, and meanwhile they
had been published as deserters.</p>

<p>At another time, taking a fancy to a regimental
band which came aboard the Boston in an Italian
port, he sailed for America with the musicians,
and it was several years before they were all returned
to Italy.</p>

<p>The Boston soon after this returned to the
United States, and the administration of the navy
winked at Captain McNeill's peccadilloes, in view
of the actual service he had done during his
memorable cruise.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the government determined
to send a force out, under Commodore
Preble, to crush Tripoli. Somers got the command
of the Nautilus, one of the four small
vessels that were built and sent out, Stewart
getting another, and Decatur a third. Somers
was now in his twenty-fifth year, handsome, well
made, and his naturally dark skin still darker from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>wind and sun. His manners were polished, and
he was as prepossessing, in his quiet way, as the
dashing Decatur. Somers's black eyes were noticeably
melancholy, and after his untimely death
those who loved him fancied they had always
seen in his countenance some premonition of his
doom.</p>

<p>The officers who were to command these little
vessels superintended their building, as there
were then no regular navy-yards in the country.
The Nautilus, under Somers's command, was the
first to sail, and the first to arrive at Gibraltar,
in July, 1803. She was a beautiful little schooner,
of twelve guns, with a crew of nearly a hundred
men. She was, however, very small to cross the
Atlantic, and several times during the voyage
Somers was hailed and offered assistance by
friendly shipmasters, who thought the gallant
little vessel must have been blown out of her
course.</p>

<p>Somers was one of the boy captains whose
youth so disgusted Commodore Preble when he
met them first on their arrival at Gibraltar. But
the commodore found in Somers, as early as
with any, the stuff of which these young officers
were made. Somers was very actively engaged
in the labors and cruises which occupied the
winter of 1803-4, preparing to attack Tripoli
in the summer. He sympathized ardently with
Decatur in the splendid exploit of the destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>of the Philadelphia. He was anxious to assist
him with the Nautilus, but Stewart's superior
rank and larger command entitled him to support
Decatur, which he did in the Siren. Decatur's
success inspired every young captain in the
squadron with a noble desire to equal it, and
none more than the quiet and self-contained
Somers.</p>

<p>The preparations for the bombardment of
Tripoli continued, and on the 3d of August the
first attack took place. Commodore Preble gave
the command of the right division of gun-vessels
to Somers, and the left to Decatur. Somers
was supposed to be Decatur's senior at the time,
but the post-captain's commission which the
Congress had given Decatur as a reward for the
destruction of the Philadelphia was then on its
way, and arrived a few days after; while the
same ship brought Somers's promotion to a master
commandant.</p>

<p>The story of those splendid attacks has been
told in the biographies of Preble and Decatur.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> On
the memorable 3d of August, when the captives of
the Philadelphia in the Bashaw's dungeons first
heard from the guns of the squadron the thundering
demand for the release of the prisoners,
Somers, like Decatur, performed prodigies of
valor. The harbor of Tripoli is crossed by a
great reef, above the water, and on which forts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>batteries were mounted. At the western end is
a narrow opening of about two hundred yards,
while within the reef the rocks and shoals were so
numerous and so difficult that the best seamanship
and the greatest courage were necessary for
an attacking enemy. The guns from the forts
and ships nearer the town, too, could be concentrated
on any small craft which passed through
this western passage. These desperate risks did
not deter Somers and Decatur, who went inside
and fell upon the Tripolitan gun-vessels with the
fury of fiends. On the 3d of August, while Decatur
was engaged in his terrible encounter with the
Tripolitan, Somers in a single small gun-vessel
held at bay five gun-vessels, each larger than his
own, and fought with savage determination.
The wind was driving him straight on the rocks,
and he had to keep backing his sweeps to save
himself from destruction, while fighting like a
lion. The Constitution, seeing his critical position,
came to his support, and, opening her batteries
on the Tripolitans, succeeded in driving them
still farther within the reefs, while Somers brought
his gallant little gun-vessel out in triumph.</p>

<p>Four of these dashing attacks were made, in
every one of which Somers and Decatur commanded
the two boat divisions. Both had many
narrow escapes. Once, while Somers was leaning
against the flagstaff of his little vessel, as
she was on her way to attack, he saw a round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>shot coming. He jumped aside, and the next
moment the flagstaff was shattered just at the
point where his head had rested. His knowledge
of the interior of the harbor, where the Tripolitans
had a large number of vessels at anchor, inspired
him with the design of leading a forlorn
hope,&mdash;to strike one great blow, and, if necessary,
to die for his country the next moment. At
last he got Commodore Preble's permission to
carry out the daring attempt, which, heroic in its
conception, yet makes one of the saddest pages
in the history of the American navy.</p>

<p>The plan was to fit up as a fire-ship, or "infernal,"
the ketch Intrepid, in which Decatur had
won immortality in the same harbor, take it
in, and explode it among the Tripolitan fleet.
Somers earnestly begged Commodore Preble for
the honor of leading this desperate expedition,
and the commodore at last agreed. It would be
necessary to pour one hundred barrels of gunpowder
into the hold of the ketch in order to
make it effective as a fire-ship, and before consenting
to this, the Commodore warned Somers
that so much powder must not be allowed to fall
into the hands of the Tripolitans. It was during
the Napoleonic wars, powder was in great
demand, and the Tripolitans were supposed to be
short of it. After this interview Somers expressed
the determination to be blown up rather
than to be captured.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The details of the attack were worked out most
carefully. Besides the powder, the Intrepid was
to carry a large stock of splintered wood; and
about two hundred shells, with their fuses prepared,
were laid on her decks, to add their horrors
to the explosion. The brave adventurers had two
chances for their lives, in having two boats in
which to escape from the ketch. One of them
was a very fast four-oared boat from Somers's
own vessel, the Nautilus, and the other was
a six-oared cutter from the Constitution. Somers
was to be in his own boat, while Lieutenant
Henry Wadsworth<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> commanded the Constitution's
cutter. Ten sailors were to be taken along,
making twelve persons in all; but the number
was increased to thirteen by a little midshipman,
Joseph Israel, who smuggled himself into the
Constitution's boat.</p>

<p>Somers had consulted at every step his bosom
friend Decatur, and Charles Stewart, with whom
he had begun his naval life in "Old Wagoner."
Decatur, in his own vessel, the Argus, and Lieutenant-Commandant
Smith, of the Vixen, and
Somers's vessel, the Nautilus, under the command
of his first lieutenant, Washington Reed, were to
support the dauntless party in the boats as far as
possible.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, on the day after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>desperate boat attack of the 3d of September, in
the afternoon, Somers appeared on the deck of
his vessel, and, having the crew piped up, addressed
them, telling frankly the hazardous nature
of the attempt he was to make, and calling
for four volunteers who would go with him to
advance one step ahead of the line. For answer,
every man and boy on the Nautilus advanced
two steps. This brave spirit was deeply gratifying
to Somers, and he was forced to make a
selection. He chose four of his best seamen,&mdash;James
Simms, Thomas Tompline, James Harris,
and William Keith.</p>

<p>On the Constitution the same spirit was shown,
and Lieutenant Wadsworth selected the six men
he needed from the hundreds who were eager to
go. The Constitution's sailors were William
Harrison, Robert Clark, Hugh McCormick, Jacob
Williams, Peter Renner, and Isaac Downes. The
names of these humble men deserve to be recorded,
for each one was worthy to do, to dare,
and to die with his officers,&mdash;Somers, Wadsworth,
and Israel.</p>

<p>When the last preparations were made, on
the afternoon of September 4, 1804, and the
men were assembled on the Nautilus's deck, with
the boats lowered, Somers addressed the ten
sailors. He told them that he wanted no man
with him who would not rather be blown up than
surrender to the Tripolitans. The men responded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>with a cheer; and it was found that each one had
privately asked Somers for the dangerous honor
of applying the match when the time for the
explosion came. They then said good-bye to
their shipmates, and indicated what they wished
done with their belongings if they should never
return. Somers was accompanied to the Intrepid
by Decatur and Stewart, who remained
with him until the dusk of the September evening
warned them that the solemn hour had come.
On parting from them, Somers, who was as tranquil
as ever, took a ring from his finger, and,
breaking it in three parts, gave one piece to
Decatur, one to Stewart, and kept the third.
The last man over the Intrepid's side was Lieutenant
Reed, who, as Somers's first lieutenant,
was to command the Nautilus.</p>

<p>The night had fallen when the Constitution's
boat joined the ketch, and in it was found the
little fifteen-year-old midshipman, Israel, who had
pleaded to go, and, being refused, had smuggled
himself into the boat. There was then no way of
getting rid of him, and, admiring his bold determination,
Somers welcomed him on the ketch.
There was a light blue haze on the water, and
the night was murky as the "infernal" stole
upon her way. She entered the harbor silently,
while outside, in the offing, the Nautilus, the Argus,
and the Vixen stood in as close as they
dared. Presently, in the darkness, the Siren was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>observed to flit past them. Stewart, in his anxiety
for Somers, had implored Commodore Preble to
let him be near the scene of action, and the commodore
had consented.</p>

<p>The Siren ventured farther into the offing
than the other vessels, and Stewart and his officers,
like every officer and man on all of the
ships, was intent upon the black shadow of the
fire-ship, as she crept in among the rocks. She
was soon discovered, in spite of the darkness, and
a few grape-shot were thrown at her. Stewart
was standing in the Siren's gangway, with one
of his lieutenants, anxiously watching through
his night-glass the progress of the Intrepid,
when the officer cried, "Look! see the light!"
A light, like a lantern, was seen to flash across
the Intrepid's deck. The next moment a roar
as if worlds were crashing together shook the
castle and forts, and rocked the ships in the
offing; a red glare hideously illumined the sea
and sky; the masts and sails of the ketch rose up
in the burning air for a moment, then fell into
the fire-lit waves, and all was over. A frightful
and unearthly silence and darkness succeeded.
The brigs and schooners cruised about, their
officers and men in anguish over the fate of
their brave companions. The Constitution fired
minute-guns all night, so that if any survived that
awful explosion they might know they were not
forgotten. When sunrise came, thirteen blackened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>bodies floated ashore at Tripoli. They were
so disfigured that the officers could only be told
from the men by the softness of their hands.
Bainbridge and his officers were taken from their
captivity to identify the remains of the thirteen
brave souls who had given life itself to hasten the
release of the Philadelphia's gallant company.
Not the slightest damage was done to the Tripolitan
ships or forts, or to the town itself.</p>

<p>The ten sailors were buried together near the
beach, while the three officers were laid in the same
grave on a plain a little southward of the castle.
Whether Somers blew the ketch up, in his conception
of his duty, or whether the powder was accidentally
ignited, can never be ascertained. All
that is known, however, is that he did his duty,
as did every officer and man lost in that perilous
attempt. Of each of them may be said as is
written after the name of the little midshipman,
Israel, in the records of the navy, "Died, with
honor, in the service, September 4, 1804."</p>

<p>His country honored Somers by naming for
him a beautiful little brig; but like him it was
doomed to misfortune. One of the most terrible
tragedies that ever occurred in the American
navy took place upon the deck of the Somers,
and it was afterward lost at sea, going down, as
Somers did, in the darkness and silence of an
unfathomed mystery.</p>

<h2>ISAAC HULL.</h2>


<p>The American navy has produced many men
great in the handling of sailing-ships; but no
more capable seaman ever trod the quarter-deck
than Isaac Hull. In all of his achievements his
faculty of handling his vessel, whether great or
small, to the utmost possible advantage, was the
most considerable factor in his success; and his
tremendous popularity with seamen, who were
always eager to ship with him, came from their
conviction that in time of stress and danger they
had a born sailor to look out for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_163"></a>
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="400" height="549" alt="Isaac Hull" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Isaac Hull</span></span>
</div>

<p>Hull was the son of a Revolutionary officer,
and was born at Derby, Massachusetts, in March,
1775, shortly before the affairs at Lexington and
Concord. His father was taken prisoner and
died on one of the Jersey prison ships, and Isaac
was adopted by an uncle, General Hull. The
means and station of the Hull family were such
that a liberal education was within the lad's
reach, and he was destined for a course at Yale
College. But he early developed a passion for
the sea; and his uncle, seeing the boy's determined
bent, concluded to let him carry it out. The Continental
navy had passed out of existence, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>reorganization did not take place until 1797-98,
so that a naval career was not open to him at
the start. General Hull, however, did the next
best thing possible for the boy, by sending him to
sea in a fine ship owned by a friend of the Hull
family. Isaac proved himself capable and industrious
from the start, and by the time he reached
his twenty-first birthday was in command of a
small vessel. The desire to hold a commission
in the regular navy possessed him, and in March,
1798, he got a fourth lieutenant's commission,
which was dated on his twenty-third birthday.</p>

<p>His first cruise was made in the ship in which
he was afterward to win such splendid renown,&mdash;the
Constitution. She was then commanded
by Captain Samuel Nicholson. He remained in
her for more than two years, and thus became
thoroughly familiar with the great frigate,&mdash;a
knowledge he was eventually to put to good use.
In 1800 she was the flagship of Commodore Talbot,
in the West Indies, and Hull was her first lieutenant.
Commodore Talbot and the captain of a
British frigate on that station were friends, and the
American and British captains would often discuss
the sailing qualities of their respective frigates,
the British ship being a good sailer as well as
the Constitution. At last a sailing-match was
agreed upon, the captains wagering a cask of
wine on the result. The two frigates started with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>a fresh breeze at sunrise, and the contest was to
last until the sunset gun was fired. Hull sailed
the Constitution, and his seamanship on that
day of friendly rivalry was scarcely inferior to
that which he displayed when Admiral Broke's
squadron of five ships was hounding him on an
August day, twelve years after. The Constitution
could easily leg it at an eleven-knot gait,
with a tolerable breeze, and was almost unapproachable
on a wind; but that day, under Hull's
skilful handling, she outdid herself, and beat her
opponent by several miles. Hull kept the crew
on deck the livelong day, and the seamanlike
manner in which he beat the English frigate,
which was also remarkably well sailed, won the
admiration even of his opponents. Hull was too
great a seaman himself to underrate either British
skill or pluck, and many years after it is told of
him that, speaking with a very steady old boatswain,
the man remarked, "The British, sir, are
hard fellows on salt water."</p>

<p>"I know that,&mdash;they are a hard set of fellows,
sure enough," was Hull's emphatic reply.</p>

<p>Hull saw no very brilliant service during the
hostilities with France in 1799-1800, but he cut
out a French letter-of-marque in the harbor of
Port Platte, Hayti, in a very handsome manner.
He armed a small vessel, the Sally, with men
from the Constitution, ran into the harbor in
broad daylight, landed a company of marines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>who spiked the guns of the fort and carried off
the French letter-of-marque in fine style.</p>

<p>In 1802 Hull went to the Adams, of twenty-eight
guns, as her first lieutenant. The Adams
was one of the fastest frigates that ever floated,
and Hull was the man to get the most out of her.
She was sent to the Mediterranean at the beginning
of the Tripolitan troubles, and in her patrol
of the Straits of Gibraltar in all weathers, and
her blockade of Tripoli in the dangerous winter
season, her first lieutenant splendidly sustained
the reputation he had brought from the Constitution
with him, as one of the ablest seamen in
the navy. He would carry more sail than any
other lieutenant in the squadron would have
carried, and would make sail when most ships
scarcely showed a rag of canvas.</p>

<p>In 1803 he got his first command, the little
schooner Enterprise, which he exchanged, after
a short time, with Decatur, who brought out from
America the Argus, a handsome sixteen-gun brig,
lately off the stocks. In the Argus he took an
active part in the bombardment of Tripoli, and
manifested his usual steadiness and coolness.
Commodore Preble, wishing to examine the harbor
as closely as practicable during the bombardment,
trusted to Hull's seamanship to get him
the best view possible, and reconnoitred one night
in the Argus. It came near being the end of the
vessel and all on board, by one of those accidents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>against which skill and courage avail nothing.
A heavy shot struck the brig's bottom, and
raked it for several feet, ripping the plank out as
it went. Had it gone an inch deeper, the ship's
bottom would have been out; but the gallant brig
and her brave company were saved for great services
to their country.</p>

<p>After the reduction of the Barbary powers Hull
returned home, and in 1806 he reached the rank
of post-captain. He was then thirty-one years
old, short and stocky, but military in his bearing,
prompt and decided in his manner, kind to his
men, but a firm disciplinarian. He was singularly
chivalrous to women, and treated the humblest
woman with the highest respect.</p>

<p>In 1811 Hull got the Constitution, and with
her, Lieutenant, afterward Commodore, Charles
Morris, a lieutenant worthy of such a captain.
In the celebrated chase of the Constitution the
following year, scarcely less praise is due to
Morris, then her first lieutenant, than to Hull.</p>

<p>The Constitution's first duty was to take a
large amount of specie to Holland, in payment of
interest on a debt due by the United States. From
thence she proceeded to Portsmouth, England.</p>

<p>By that time it was known that war was imminent,
and Hull kept his ship prepared for action
at a moment's notice. It seemed at one time
as if the Constitution would fire the first gun of
the conflict in an English port. The Havana,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>frigate, lay close to the Constitution, and one
night a man from the American frigate jumped
overboard and swam to the Havana, where he
was taken aboard. Next morning Hull sent a
boat with Morris, to ask the man's surrender.
The British captain declined to give him up, saying
that the man swore he was a British subject.
As the British navy made laws for the navies of
the world in those days, the Americans had to
submit with a very bad grace. But compensation
was at hand. A man from the Havana, seeing
the turn of affairs, jumped overboard and
swam to the Constitution. He was welcomed on
board, one may be sure, and when the Havana's
lieutenant sent after him, Hull coolly announced
that the man said he was an American citizen,
and therefore would not be given up. The British
captain had to be satisfied with this answer. But
there was some expectation that an attempt would
be made to seize the man by force. Meanwhile
Hull concluded to change his berth, the Havana
and her consort being a little too near; so
he picked up his anchor, and dropped down to
leeward a mile or two. The Havana promptly
followed him. Hull then thought it likely that
he would be attacked before morning, and made
his preparations accordingly. The ship was
cleared for action, the cabin torn out of the way,
the battle lanterns lighted, and the men sent to
their quarters at the tap of the drum. Hull,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>full of fire and determination, said to the
men,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lads, are you ready for a fight? I don't
know but what this frigate is after us. Are you
ready for her?"</p>

<p>The reply was a rousing American cheer.
Even some men who were in irons joined in the
cheering, and contrived to get a message to the
captain asking to be released during the time of
the expected fight, that they might do their duty.
This was done, and amid the greatest enthusiasm
the guns were cast loose. It was noted that the men
took hold of the gun tackles as if they meant to
jerk the guns through the ship's side. Lieutenant
Morris, passing along the batteries, told the men
that if the ship had to fight, it would be in their
quarrel, and he hoped they would give a good
account of themselves. The reply of these gallant
tars was, "Let the quarterdeck look out for
the colors, and we will look out for the guns."</p>

<p>Some hours having passed, with the Constitution
plainly ready for a fight, without any
demonstration from the British frigate, Hull determined
to lift his anchor and sail for France.
The men responded with a loud groan to the
boatswain's call to man the capstan bars, and,
sailor-like, were acutely disappointed that they
got off without a chance to show what the ship
could do.</p>

<p>Hull returned to the United States, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>June, 1812, war was declared. The Constitution
was at Annapolis, where she had been newly
coppered, and where a sloop-of-war was also being
fitted out. A report got about, among the Constitution's
crew, that men were to be drafted from
her to the sloop-of-war. This created great dissatisfaction.
The men, nearly all native-born
Americans, although new to the ship, were proud
of her, and had a superstitious faith in her good
fortune and were devoted to their captain. Their
complaints became almost mutinous, when Hull
appeared among them and assured them that not
a man should be taken out of the ship. This
pacified them, and on the 14th of July, 1812,
they sailed for New York, to join Commodore
Rodgers's squadron. About four o'clock on the
morning of July 19th, the cry rang through the
ship that the American squadron was sighted;
but as day broke, it was found that the Constitution
was almost surrounded by a British squadron
under Admiral Broke, one of the finest seamen
in the British navy. It consisted of the Africa,
sixty-four; the frigates Shannon and Guerrière,
of thirty-eight guns each (with the last the Constitution
was to have it out, yardarm to yardarm,
that day month); the light frigates Belvidera and
Eolus; and two small vessels. By sunrise it fell
almost calm, and it seemed as if the glorious
frigate would have to lie where she was, to be
eaten up by her enemies as soon as the wind rose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>But Hull and Morris were men of resource, and
while fully prepared to go down fighting, if necessary,
they knew a way of getting off even without
a wind. All the spare hawsers in the ship were
bent together, and to a kedge anchor which was
put in a boat, sent ahead half a mile, and let go.
The crew, at a signal, clapped on, and walked
away with the ship. Before she lost the impetus
gained by rousing on the one kedge, another one
was carried ahead and let go; and so she progressed
at the rate of about three knots an hour.
At first the British were amazed to see her trotting
off without a wind; but they soon found out
what was going on, and put all the available boats
in the squadron to towing the Shannon after the
Constitution. The Shannon, however, could not
make much headway, as Hull had mounted stern-chasers
in the cabin, and fired on the British boats
whenever they came within range.</p>

<p>The Shannon, however, was coming up on the
starboard, while the other ships were towing,
kedging, and sending their boats ahead with
sweeps, to surround the gallant frigate. The
Guerrière, too, was nearing her on the port
quarter, and men less resourceful than Hull and
his officers would have despaired of escape. But
just then a light breeze struck the ship, the sails
were trimmed, and the ship came by the wind
beautifully. This brought the Guerrière nearly
within gunshot, and she roared out her broadside;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>but the Constitution's people continued hoisting
up their boats with as much coolness and steadiness
as if the cannonade were no more than birdshot.
For an hour the Constitution legged it at
a lively rate; but about ten o'clock it fell calm,
and the wearisome and tedious method of kedging
was again resorted to. The British put nearly all
their boats on the Shannon, but in spite of numbers
the American frigate managed to keep just
out of gunshot.</p>

<p>Every device known to seamanship was used to
increase the distance between the frigate and her
pursuers. Her sails were wet down fore and aft,
several thousand gallons of water were pumped
out of her, the boat's falls were kept in hand to
run the boats up, and every cat's paw was taken
advantage of with the finest possible seamanship.
Yet so hopeless did her chances seem that Admiral
Broke had a prize crew told off, to take her into
Halifax! Neither Hull nor his officers or men
contemplated for a moment giving up the frigate.
Hull knew his ship; he had a remarkably capable
set of officers, and his ship was so well manned
by intelligent Americans that it was said in a
very little while after they had enlisted the crew
could have sailed and fought the ship without
their officers.</p>

<p>About two o'clock the Belvidera got within
range and began to throw her broadside; but Hull,
after returning a few shot, devoted himself strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>to keeping his ship away from her enemies. All
day the British ships used every method that
skill could devise to get at the Constitution, but
were able neither to overhaul her nor to close
with her. At eleven o'clock at night a breeze
sprang up which lasted for an hour, when it died
away. During that night neither the Constitution
nor her pursuers kedged, the crews on all
the ships being too exhausted; but no officer
or man on the Constitution went below. The
officers lay down at their stations, and the sailors
slept at their guns, with their rammers and
sponges at their sides.</p>

<p>With daylight came wind enough to keep the
ships moving, and at sunrise the sight was singularly
beautiful. The summer sea was faintly
rippled by a long, soft swell, and the sun shone
with unclouded splendor. The five pursuing ships,
as well as the Constitution, were clouds of canvas,
from rail to truck, and all six were on the
same tack. Including the six men-of-war, eleven
sail were in sight. The British squadron had
been joined by the Nautilus, brig, and the rest
were merchantmen. During the morning an
American merchant ship was observed approaching.
The Constitution, seeing the ship was unaware
of her danger, hoisted an English ensign
and fired a gun at her,&mdash;which induced her to
run away from her supposed enemy.</p>

<p>All day the chase continued; but the Constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>showed a clean pair of heels, and was
slowly, though steadily, widening the distance
between herself and her pursuers. In the afternoon
a heavy squall with rain came up. The
Constitution took in her sails, which induced the
British ships to do the same. But as soon as she
was hid by the curtain of falling rain, she made
sail upon her stout masts, that carried her along
at a rattling gait. In about an hour the weather
cleared, when it was seen that the Belvidera,
the nearest vessel, was far astern, the others
were more distant still, the Africa being hull
down. The chase was still kept up during the
whole of that night, but at daylight next morning
the British ships were almost out of sight, and
about eight o'clock they hauled their wind and
gave up the contest.</p>

<p>Not only had the noble frigate escaped from her
enemies, but she had done so without losing a
gun, an anchor, or a boat. She was ready at any
moment of the chase to go into action, and the
steadiness, coolness, and precision of her man&oelig;uvres
were never surpassed. This chase is one of
the glories of the American navy,&mdash;not merely because
of the escape itself, but by reason of the seamanlike
manner in which it was accomplished.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the Constitution ran the blockade
and got into Boston, to hear the news
that she had been captured!</p>

<p>The delight of the people at the escape of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>favorite frigate was unbounded. Hull was hailed
as a hero; but with characteristic modesty he
ascribed most of the credit of his escape to his
officers and crew, both in his official report and
a published card.</p>

<p>Having had an intimation, however, that it
was in contemplation to give the ship to Bainbridge,
in virtue of his superior rank, and without
waiting for orders, which might be just what
he did not want, Hull sailed eastward as soon as
he had watered and victualled his ship. On the
afternoon of the 19th of August, just one month
to a day after he had first been chased by the
Guerrière, he ran across her again, and both
ships prepared to fight it out, with the greatest
spirit imaginable.</p>

<p>Captain Dacres, of the Guerrière, and Hull
were personal friends, as many of the American
and British captains were in those days, and there
was a standing bet of a hat between them on the
result in case their two ships ever came to exchanging
broadsides. The Guerrière was an extremely
fine French-built frigate, carrying fifty
guns,&mdash;the Constitution carried fifty-four and
her broadside was much the heavier. In men,
the Constitution had also the advantage of the
British ship, but the damage inflicted by the
Constitution was far in excess of her superiority
in men and metal. On the Guerrière's great
mainsail was inscribed in huge red letters,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All who meet me have a care,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I am England's Guerrière."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The two ships were looking for each other,
when on the 19th of August, about ten o'clock,
a sail being reported off the port bow, a midshipman
was sent aloft to try and make her out. All
hands were hoping the stranger was the Guerrière,
when Hull called out with animation,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think she is?"</p>

<p>"She's a great vessel, sir. Tremendous sails."</p>

<p>"Never mind," coolly replied Hull, turning to
the boatswain. "Mr. Adams, call all hands.
Make sail for her."</p>

<p>Before the boatswain's pipe was heard, the men
came tumbling up on deck, even the sick turning
out of their berths. Hull, in his official report of
the battle, says: "From the smallest boy in the
ship up to the oldest seaman, not a look of fear
was seen. They went into action giving three
cheers, and requesting to be laid alongside the
enemy." When the call to quarters was heard
through the ship, the men went to the guns
dancing. Sail was crowded on, and soon it was
seen that the stranger was the Guerrière. She
had hauled her wind, and lay with her topsails
aback, gallantly waiting for her enemy. Her
officers and crew prepared to meet the Americans
with the spirit of British seamen. There were
ten Americans in the crew who came to Captain
Dacres and told him they could not fight against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>their own country. The captain magnanimously
told them to go below, and assist in the cockpit
with the wounded.</p>

<p>As soon as the Constitution got within range,
the Guerrière let fly her batteries, firing the starboard
guns, then wearing and giving the Constitution
her port guns. The Constitution came
on, yawing at intervals to prevent being raked,
and occasionally firing one of her bow guns.
Three times Lieutenant Morris asked permission
to fire a broadside, and each time Hull answered,
"Not yet." At last, when within fifty yards of
the Guerrière, the moment had come. Hull
spoke a few stirring words to his people.</p>

<p>"Men!" he said, "now do your duty. Your
officers cannot have entire command over you now.
Each man must do all in his power for his country.
No firing at random. Let every man look well to
his aim. Sailing-master, lay her alongside."</p>

<p>The Constitution came up into the wind in
gallant style, and as she fell off a little, the
Guerrière, an antagonist worthy of the great
frigate, ranged alongside. The Constitution let
fly every gun in her starboard batteries at short
range, and the shock was like an earthquake.
Every timber in the frigate trembled like a leaf.
When the smoke cleared away, it was seen that
this terrific broadside had made destruction on the
British ship. Her mizzen-mast had gone by the
board, her mainyard had been shot from the slings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>and a momentary confusion reigned on her decks.
The effect of their first broadside was so encouraging
to the Americans that before firing
another gun they gave three thundering cheers.
The English officers spoke afterward of the extra
ordinary enthusiasm of the Americans, which
was a part of the fury of their attack.</p>

<p>When the cheers had subsided, Hull called out,
"My lads, you have made a brig of that craft;"
to which the sailors shouted back, "We'll make
a sloop of her soon, sir;" and in a little while
the foremast went by the board. The Guerrière
then swung round, and, being almost unmanageable,
got into a terrible position for raking.
Her officers and men fought with undiminished
valor, and when the ensign was shot away, another
one was nailed to the stump of the mizzen-mast.
On the Constitution the halyards were
shot away, and the flag became entangled in the
splinters of a shattered yard. A sailor sprang aloft
and nailed it to the mast, and both ships continued
the action without thought of surrender.</p>

<p>The Guerrière, however, was plainly getting
the worst of it. Most of her fire was directed to
the masts and spars of the Constitution, while
several shot that struck the frigate's hull rebounded
into the water. At this the sailors
cheered.</p>

<p>"Huzza!" they cried. "Her sides are made
of iron! Huzza for Old 'Ironsides'!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>Then some one on the Constitution, pointing
to the captain, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hull her, men! Hull her!"</p>

<p>The sailors, catching the pun, roared out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hull her! Hull her! Yes, we'll hull her!"</p>

<p>Hull, who had grown very stout, and was short
withal, was standing on an ammunition box, while
shot flew thick and fast around him. Leaning
over to give an order, his knee breeches, which
were very tight, burst from knee to hip. The
men shouted with laughter; but it was no time to
repair such damages, and Hull finished the battle
with his trousers hanging in rags.</p>

<p>It was not to last long. The mainmast soon
followed the other masts, and in thirty minutes
from the time the Constitution's first broadside
had been fired, the Guerrière lay, a helpless
hulk, rolling in the trough of the sea, that washed
into her shattered main-deck ports.</p>

<p>Her masts and spars having gone by the board,
she swung round, so that she lay perfectly helpless,
while every gun in the Constitution raked her.
The men could see the whites of each other's eyes,
and the gleam of the teeth as they fought. Captain
Dacres had been badly wounded, while standing
in the hammock nettings cheering his men
on, a vast number of officers and men killed and
wounded, and the Guerrière's decks ran with blood.
But even in these dreadful circumstances not a
man or boy on the British ship faltered; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>when it was plain to every eye that resistance was
over for the proud Guerrière, one of her powder
boys was heard to shout to another confidently,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Work away there! Huzza! She'll soon be
ours!"</p>

<p>Her captain saw that it was time to stop the
useless slaughter, and a gun was fired to leeward,
which signified surrender. But her men
refused to haul down the jack they had nailed to
the stump of the mizzen-mast, and not until Captain
Dacres stepped into the Constitution's boat
did the brave men and boys of the Guerrière
acknowledge themselves beaten. It was, indeed,
an idea almost impossible for them to grasp,
that a crack British frigate should have been
whipped in fair fight by an American; but it is
easily understood when it is remembered that they
were men of the same stock,&mdash;for the Constitution
was wholly manned by native-born Americans, who
came justly by that genius for fighting at sea which
is the common heritage of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>As Captain Dacres came over the side of the
Constitution, Hull met him with the cordiality
of a friend and shipmate instead of the air of a
conqueror. He gave the British captain a hand,
saying, with the greatest friendliness,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dacres, I see you are hurt. Let me help you."</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Dacres reached the Constitution's
deck, he attempted to hand his sword
to Hull, who said,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, no, I cannot take the sword of a man who
knows so well how to use it; but&mdash;I'll thank you
for that hat!"</p>

<p>The business of transferring the prisoners then
began. It was seen at once there was no hope of
saving the Guerrière, and it was determined to
remove everything of value and then blow her up.
The damages to the Constitution were repaired
in an hour. She had lost seven men killed and
seven wounded. The Guerrière had lost seventy-nine
in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The Constitution lay by the Guerrière all night,
and the Americans worked like Trojans to save
the belongings of the prisoners. Hull asked
Captain Dacres if everything of value had been
sent him out of the Guerrière's cabin. Captain
Dacres replied that a Bible, his wife's gift, had
been left behind. Hull immediately sent a boat
after it. Captain Dacres, in his report to the
Admiralty, said: "I feel it my duty to state that
the conduct of Captain Hull and his officers to
our men has been that of a brave enemy, the
greatest care being taken to prevent our men
losing the smallest trifle, and the greatest attention
being paid to the wounded."</p>

<p>After working all night the morning of the
20th of August saw the brave but unfortunate
Guerrière made ready for her ocean grave. A
slow match was applied to her magazine, and
the Constitution bore away. About three miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>off she hove to, while her officers and men, together
with those of the doomed frigate, waited
breathlessly for the explosion. As the fire gained
headway, a dense volume of smoke formed over
her. Some of her guns had been left shotted, and
as the fire reached them, they began to go off,
their sullen boom over the sea sounding like the
death-knell of the gallant ship. Presently the
flames reached the magazine. Streams of light,
and a roar that seemed to shake the deep, followed;
a mass of wreckage flew skyward; the
Guerrière was no more.</p>

<p>There was great uneasiness felt on board the
Constitution in regard to the large number of
prisoners she carried. There were not enough
handcuffs in the ship for the whole British crew,
and the Americans felt a manly unwillingness to
handcuff any of the men who had fought them so
bravely. But it was noted that from the start
the prisoners and their captors behaved well, the
American and British sailors sitting around the
fok'sle together, spinning yarns, exchanging tobacco,
and chumming quite amicably.</p>

<p>Hull made for Boston, and on his arrival there
was greeted with the wildest enthusiasm. The
people were beside themselves with joy. Before
this a British ship had been deemed invincible,
and the knowledge that one of these great ships,
with a captain and crew worthy of her, had struck
to an American captain who had never before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>handled a frigate in action, was gratifying to the
national pride. Hull, to his great discomfiture,
was seized, as he stepped upon the dock, and carried
on the shoulders of his admirers to his destination.
A grand banquet was given to him and
his officers in Faneuil Hall. Congress had a
medal struck in his honor, and gave swords to
the officers and a handsome sum in prize money
to the crew. So great was Hull's popularity that
the commissioners of the navy would not have
taken the ship away from him, had he asked to
retain her, but with true magnanimity he gave
her up to Bainbridge. Hull knew that Bainbridge
was justly entitled to her, and he was not the man
to withhold anything from a brother in arms.
Bainbridge therefore took her, and went out and
captured the Java.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Hull was actively, though not brilliantly, employed
during the rest of the war, but did not get
afloat again, as there were more captains than
frigates. In 1813 he married a beautiful girl, the
daughter of a clergyman. She had laughed at
his pretensions when he was only a lieutenant;
but after his great cruise she said, when she knew
it would be repeated to Hull, "How delightful it
must be to be the wife of a hero!" He took the
hint, and soon after they were married.</p>

<p>Hull's subsequent career was one of honor and
usefulness. He was a great hater of idleness, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>often said, "Idleness will soon bring any man to
ruin." He had fine commands, both ashore and
afloat, and hoisted his broad pennant over several
splendid squadrons. In 1836 he commanded
the Mediterranean station. At Gibraltar he found
his old friend Dacres, then an admiral, also in
command of a squadron. The two met with delight.
Admiral Dacres showed Commodore Hull
the greatest attention, and at a splendid dinner
given in his honor on the British flagship the
admiral told Mrs. Hull, who was present, the story
of the saving of his wife's Bible. Later, both of
them having been detached from their squadrons,
they were in Rome for a winter together, and were
inseparable. Admiral Dacres was a remarkably
tall, thin man, while Commodore Hull was somewhat
the size and shape of a hogshead; and
the wags had infinite amusement over the queer
figures of these two heroic men.</p>

<p>On Commodore Hull's retirement he made his
home in Philadelphia. He always wore his uniform,
and as he walked the streets every hat was
doffed to him, and the salute was courteously returned.
The end came in February, 1843. His
last words were, "I strike my flag,"&mdash;words that
he had never before had occasion to utter. He
was a devout Christian, and during his whole life
he honestly lived up to the requirements of a
just and pious manhood.</p>

<h2>CHARLES STEWART.</h2>


<p>In the splendid galaxy of naval officers of the
early part of the century each one seems to have
gained some special distinction, equally brilliant,
but differing entirely from any other. Thus, as
Hull made the most remarkable escape on record,
and Decatur succeeded in the most daring enterprise,
so Stewart may be credited with the most
superb seamanship in the one great fight that fell
to his lot, for with one ship, the glorious Constitution,
he fought two vessels at the same time,
raking them repeatedly, without once being raked
himself, and in the end forcing the surrender of
both his antagonists.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Charles Stewart</span></span>
</div>

<p>Charles Stewart was born in Philadelphia in
1778, and entered the merchant service at thirteen
years of age. At twenty he had risen to the
command of a fine vessel in the India trade, but
on the reorganization of the navy in 1798 he was
given a naval commission. His rise in the navy
was rapid, as he was an accomplished seaman
when he joined it. After serving for a short
time as a midshipman, he was made the junior
lieutenant on the United States, frigate, when
she was commissioned at the beginning of hostilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>with France. With him on this cruise were
Decatur and Somers; and, as Fenimore Cooper
aptly says, the noble frigate turned out to be a
nursery of heroes.</p>

<p>Stewart began the cruise as fourth, and ended
it as first, lieutenant. He was of commanding figure
and of pleasing address, and his capacity was
such that from the first he was thought likely to
distinguish himself.</p>

<p>When the United States was laid up in ordinary,
Stewart was given the command of a small
schooner, the Experiment. In this little vessel he
showed much spirit and enterprise, making many
captures, and fighting whenever he had a chance.</p>

<p>Stewart was, like Decatur, of an impetuous and
even domineering disposition, and made everybody
under him "walk Spanish," as the sailors
said. But he himself knew how to obey promptly.
Once, having received a peremptory order from
his superior officer to report with his ship immediately,
Stewart sailed, towing his mainmast after
him, as he had not time to have it fitted and did
not choose to wait.</p>

<p>In 1803 he was sent to the Mediterranean with
the Siren, a beautiful little cruiser, as a part
of Commodore Preble's squadron destined to
reduce Tripoli. Stewart was the senior among
the commodore's "schoolboy captains," and second
in command to Commodore Preble himself.</p>

<p>Although he had no opportunity of performing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>deeds like Decatur's in the Tripolitan war, his
general good conduct was highly praised, and
the Siren was brilliantly engaged in all the
glorious actions of that famous time. At the
beginning of the war of 1812 Stewart was given
the command of the Constellation, frigate, which
shared with the Constitution the reputation of
being a lucky ship,&mdash;lucky in meeting and
whipping her enemies when the force was anything
like equal, and lucky in running away
when they were too many for her. Stewart
took command of this noble ship at Annapolis
in 1813. He was ordered to Norfolk, and took
the ship to Hampton Roads. He arrived and
anchored one night, and next morning at daylight
there were five British men-of-war in sight
of him. The Constellation endeavored to get
out of the way, and the British ships chased her,
but, the wind failing, both the pursuers and the
pursued were becalmed. Stewart, though, remembering
the Constitution's escape by kedging from
a British squadron, concluded it would never do
that the Constellation should not succeed equally
as well; so, putting out his boats, the frigate
was kedged up toward Norfolk, until the tide
fell, and she took the ground at Seawell's Point,
not far from the present Fort Monroe. The mud
was soft, the ship's bottom was hard, and the
tide would rise; so Stewart felt no alarm about
her. The British squadron were also waiting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>the tide, but they did not think that Stewart
would attempt to get his ship up the narrow and
tortuous channel to Norfolk.</p>

<p>They did not know Stewart, though. As soon
as the darkness of the winter night came, and
the tide began to lift the ship out of the mud, he
sent pilots ahead to buoy the channel with lights.
The ship, helped somewhat by the wind, but
towed by the boats, would go a mile or two up
to the nearest buoy, when that light would be
put out, and she would be headed for the next
one. So quietly was this done that the British
never suspected what was going on. But when
daylight came there was no Constellation to be
seen; she was safe in the Elizabeth River.</p>

<p>The British determined to blockade her there,
and succeeded in doing so; but although they
made several desperate attempts to carry her
by boarding, they never succeeded. Stewart had
her so well guarded with boats, and the boats
with a circle of booms, while the ship was protected
with boarding netting, her guns kept double-shotted,
and her officers and crew always on the
alert, that her enemies themselves were forced to
admire the care taken of her. It was the joke
among the British officers that Stewart must be
a Scotchman, he was so wary and so watchful
with his ship; and the British Admiral is said to
have remarked: "If that had been a French ship,
we would have had her long ago."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>Having satisfied himself that although the
Constellation could not be taken, yet it was unlikely
that she would get out during the war,
Stewart applied for and got the Constitution.
This was in 1814. The Constitution had then
made her celebrated escape from Admiral Broke's
squadron, and had destroyed the Guerrière and
the Java,&mdash;for when "Old Ironsides" got
through with an enemy, he was generally
past saving. It may be imagined with what
splendid hopes Stewart took the great ship after
she had been refitted at Boston. He got out,
although seven British ships blockaded Boston,
and sailed to the West Indies. He made a few
prizes, and took a small British cruiser; but this
was not enough for the Constitution to do.
Stewart's disappointment with his cruise was
great, and it almost seemed as if the ship were
no longer to be a favorite of fortune, until she
was chased by two frigates, the Junon and the
Tenedos, off the Massachusetts coast. Stewart
had a good pilot aboard, and he made for Marblehead
under a spanking breeze, with the two
British frigates legging it briskly after him. The
Constitution drew about twenty-two feet of water,
and Stewart could not conceal his anxiety as
the pilot carried her along the dangerous coast,
and it seemed as if any moment she might be
put on the rocks. The pilot, though, a cool-headed,
steady fellow, knew his business, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>nettled at Stewart's evident uneasiness. The
British ships, not knowing the coast, declined to
follow, and were falling slightly astern; but it
looked as if the Constitution would only escape
one danger to be destroyed by another. Presently
Stewart asked the pilot for the hundredth
time,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How many feet of water has she under her
keel now, pilot?"</p>

<p>"Two," answered the pilot; when, seeing
Stewart's countenance turn pale with apprehension,
he added nonchalantly: "And afore long
she won't have but one!"</p>

<p>The effect of this news upon the captain of a
war-ship may be imagined; but in a moment or
two the ship slipped into deep water, and, carrying
sail hard, got into Marblehead safe and
sound, while cheering multitudes flocked to the
shore to welcome her.</p>

<p>In a few days Stewart succeeded in slipping
into Boston again,&mdash;the sixth time in the course
of the war that the ship had eluded the British
blockade. Stewart took up his berth in the upper
harbor, and as he was known to be a fighting
captain with a fighting ship, the State and city
authorities concluded that they would rather have
him a little farther off. Accordingly they asked
him to take his ship down into the lower harbor,
as, if the British blockading fleet attacked him
where he was, the cannonade would do great damage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>to the town. Stewart's reply to this request
was characteristic. He coolly informed them that
he should stay where he was, but it would make
very little difference to them where he lay, as,
"if attacked, I shall make such a defence as will
endanger the town." He recommended them to
build some additional batteries to defend the
town. The authorities had to be satisfied with
this reply; but they took Stewart's advice, and
increased their batteries so that they were better
prepared than before to meet a bombardment,
should the British fleet treat them to one.</p>

<p>On the 17th of December, 1814, Stewart again
slipped past the blockading fleet, making the
seventh time the Constitution had done this, and
sailed on his last and greatest cruise. He had
lately been married, and it is said that he asked
his wife what he should bring home to her. She
replied, "A British frigate." Stewart replied,
"I will bring you two of them." He kept his
promise.</p>

<p>Stewart was soon on the broad ocean. Nothing
of note happened until February, when one
morning, off the coast of Portugal, Stewart suddenly
and from no reason he was able to give,
except an unaccountable impulse to proceed to a
certain spot in the Atlantic, changed the ship's
course and ran off sixty miles to the southwest.
At two o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th of
February, 1815, about sixty leagues southwest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>the Madeira islands, a small frigate, the Cyane,
was sighted, and a little later a large sloop-of-war,
the Levant. The Constitution immediately
gave chase, although it was thought that one of
the ships was much heavier than she really was,
as she had double gun-streaks and false ports
painted amidships, which the Americans, in
chasing, took for real guns and ports.</p>

<p>It soon became plain that the two ships were
bent on fighting, but they man&oelig;uvred in a very
masterly manner for several hours, in order to
get together before trying conclusions with the
great frigate. At five minutes past six o'clock
they hove to and hoisted their ensigns, and the
Constitution replied by showing her colors. The
three ships were arranged like the points of
an equilateral triangle,&mdash;a very advantageous
position for the two attacking ships, but one
which was turned by the superb seamanship of
Stewart to his own profit by what is commonly
esteemed to have been the finest man&oelig;uvring
ever known of an American ship in action.
Stewart fought his port and starboard batteries
alternately, giving one of his antagonists a terrible
broadside, then wearing, and letting fly at the
other, raking them repeatedly, and handling his
ship in such a manner that neither the Levant nor
the Cyane ever got in a single raking broadside.</p>

<p>Soon after the action began, a full moon arose
in splendor, and by its radiance the battle went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>on stoutly. There was a good working breeze,
and the British captains handled their ships admirably,
but "Old Ironsides" appeared to be
playing with them. She answered her helm
beautifully, and always presented her broadside
to the ship that attempted to approach her.
Soon both the British ships were suffering dreadfully,
and the leading ship, the sloop-of-war
Levant, was forced to wear under a raking broadside
from the Constitution, and ran off to leeward,
unable to stand the fire. Having disposed
of her, the Constitution now turned her attention
to the other ship, the light frigate Cyane, and
another raking broadside caused her to strike her
colors. Stewart at once sent Lieutenant Ballard
and a prize crew aboard of her, and after repairing
the slight damages his ship had sustained,
set off to look for the Levant. She too had
repaired damages, and, although free to escape,
was gallantly returning to meet her mighty antagonist
again. For a time the little Levant
bravely withstood the heavy frigate's fire, but at
last was forced to run away, the Constitution
pursuing her. The two ships were so close that
those in the Constitution could hear the planks
ripping on the Levant as the heavy shot tore
through her. At ten o'clock she was overhauled,
and forced to strike also, and the Constitution
had gained the most brilliant and seamanlike of
all her victories.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>The Constitution lost in this fight three men
killed and twelve wounded. The other two ships
lost, altogether, nineteen killed and forty-two
wounded.</p>

<p>The Constitution, with her two prizes, made
sail for Porto Praya, where they arrived on the
10th of March. Next day, about twelve o'clock,
while the captured officers of the Cyane and
Levant were on the quarter-deck, the first lieutenant,
happening to pass along, heard a little
midshipman who had been taken on the Cyane
utter an exclamation to Captain Falcon, late of
the Cyane,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Falcon," he cried, "look at the
large ship in the offing!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you little rascal!" answered
Captain Falcon, in a low voice.</p>

<p>The American lieutenant looked up and saw,
on the top of a fog bank that lay on the water,
the sails of a large ship. Indistinctly as she was
seen, the squareness and smartness of her rig induced
the lieutenant to think her a man-of-war.
Instantly he went below and told the captain.
Stewart, who was shaving, without stopping in
his occupation, directed him to call the men to
quarters, and make ready to go out and attack
the advancing ship. The lieutenant went on
deck, gave the order, and it was promptly
obeyed. The men were not surprised, because,
as they explained, a dog belonging to the ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>had been drowned that day, and they knew they
would have to fight or run within twenty-four
hours. Then the lieutenant noticed that two
more ships had appeared above the fog-bank,
with the first one. He ran below to tell this to
Stewart, who was wiping his face and getting
into his uniform at the same time.</p>

<p>"Cut the cables," he said, "and signal the
prizes to do the same and follow us out."</p>

<p>In another minute he was on deck, and the
cables were cut, leaving the anchors at the
bottom, and sail was being made with perfect
order and marvellous rapidity. In fourteen minutes
from the time the first ship had been seen,
and ten minutes from the time the Constitution's
cable had been cut, the frigate was standing
out of the roads under a cloud of canvas,
ready to fight or run, as occasion might require.</p>

<p>The trade winds were blowing, and the Constitution,
with her two prizes, passed within gunshot
of the three strangers. Some of the English
prisoners who had been landed, manned a battery
on shore and opened fire on the Americans. This
and other circumstances revealed to the British
squadron that the three ships making out to sea
were American men-of-war, and they promptly
tacked and followed.</p>

<p>The British ships were the Acasta, of forty
guns, a very fast ship; the Leander, of fifty
guns; and the Newcastle, of fifty guns, all belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>to Admiral Sir George Collier's fleet.
The British officers, prisoners on the Constitution,
became jubilant as the British ships gained
on the Constitution with her two prizes, and
promised the Americans that "Kerr in the
Acasta" would soon overhaul the Americans.
One of the British captains, standing in the
stern gallery, called out as the Acasta neared
the Constitution, "Captain Kerr, I envy you
your glory this day!"</p>

<p>Stewart, with his men at quarters and every
rag of canvas set that would draw, was edging
off, but prepared to fight the three heavy frigates
with the Constitution and the two smaller ships
if obliged to. He signalled the Cyane and
the Levant to take different courses, so that
the British squadron might divide in pursuit.
This was done, and to the amazement of the
Americans and the painful chagrin of the British
prisoners the Acasta suddenly went about in
pursuit of the Levant, which, by a singular mistake,
was supposed to be a heavy American frigate;
the other two ships followed, while the
Constitution was trotting off at an eleven-knot
gait.</p>

<p>The Levant put back to Porto Praya, which
was a neutral port; but the three frigates, after
chasing her in, opened fire on her, and her commander,
Lieutenant Ballard, of the Constitution,
hauled down his flag. He had his revenge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>though. When the British prize-master came
on board to take possession of the Levant, he
said, "This is, I presume, the American man-of-war
Peacock." "You are mistaken, sir," replied
Ballard coolly; "this is the Levant, late of his
Britannic Majesty's navy, and prize to the United
States ship Constitution."</p>

<p>The commander of the British squadron was
censured at home for his mistake in leaving the
Constitution that he might go in pursuit of
the smaller ship; and the affair on the part of
the British was thought to have been bungled
to the last degree.</p>

<p>Stewart carried the grand old ship into New
York the middle of May, and then learned that
peace had been made many months before.</p>

<p>He was received with acclamations. The people
by that time had come to believe the ship
invincible. Besides her glorious career before
Tripoli, she had made two extraordinary escapes
from British squadrons. She had run the blockade
seven times through large British fleets. She
had captured two heavy frigates, one light frigate,
a large sloop-of-war, and many merchant-ships,
and had made more than eleven hundred
prisoners. Her fire had always been fearfully
destructive, while she had never had any great
slaughter on her decks, nine being the largest
number killed in any single engagement. She
had never lost her commanding officer, either by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>wounds or death, had never lost a mast, and had
never taken the ground. This record is not one
of chance. She was, first, one of the best built
frigates in the world; and, second, she was officered
and manned in a surprisingly good manner.
Her crews were generally made up wholly of
American seamen and her four great commanders
during her warlike career&mdash;Preble, Hull,
Bainbridge, and Stewart&mdash;would have given a
good account of any ships they might have commanded.</p>

<p>Congress rewarded Stewart by a gold medal
and a resolution of thanks. His officers received
silver medals, and there was the usual distribution
of prize-money among the officers and
crew.</p>

<p>Stewart had a long and distinguished career in
the navy, rising in 1859 to be senior officer; but
his fighting days were his early days. He commanded
the Franklin in 1817, a splendid line-of-battle
ship, and took her to Europe under his
broad pennant as Commodore. She was visited
by the Emperor of Austria, and many royal persons,
besides officers of high rank in foreign
navies, all of whom were struck with admiration
at her beauty, force, and the fine crew she carried.
Stewart was retired in 1861, and spent his
last days at his country-place, "Old Ironsides,"
in New Jersey. Among the souvenirs of his great
fight was a rude iron hilt to his full-dress sword,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>a superb Toledo blade. The gold hilt had been
shot away in his great fight, and the ship's armorer
had made an iron one, which Stewart afterward
wore.</p>

<p>He died in 1869, after having been borne on the
navy list for seventy-one years, and he was the
last survivor of the great captains of 1812-15.</p>

<h2>OLIVER HAZARD PERRY.</h2>


<p>The victory won by Perry on Lake Erie, September
10, 1813, has ever been one of great popular
renown. It was won in the sight and knowledge
of the American people; it was the first
success the American navy ever won in squadron;
the consequences were important; and the
fact that the battle was won on the Canadian
line, where the American army had met with
reverses, was gratifying to the national vanity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_204"></a>
<img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="400" height="495" alt="Oliver H. Perry" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Oliver H. Perry</span></span>
</div>

<p>Perry's youth&mdash;he was barely eight-and-twenty&mdash;was
a captivating element in his success, and
as the victory was due in a great measure to his
personal intrepidity, he was justly admired for it.
He cannot be classed with those American commanders,
like Paul Jones, Preble, Decatur, and
Hull, who, either in meeting danger or escaping
from it, seemed able to compass the impossible;
but he was a man of good talents, of admirable
coolness and courage, and prone to seek active
duty and to do it.</p>

<p>Perry was born in Rhode Island in 1785. His
father was a captain in the infant navy of the
country, as it was reorganized at the time of the
French aggressions. Captain Perry's first duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>was to supervise the building of a vessel of war at
Warren, Rhode Island, some distance from his
home. He found it necessary to remove to Warren,
and took with him Mrs. Perry, leaving the
home-place in charge of Oliver, then a boy of thirteen.
He was, even then, a boy of so much
steadiness and integrity that he was found quite
equal to this task. The fever for the sea, though,
seems to have seized him about that time, and in
1799, his father having command of a small
frigate, the General Greene, Oliver was given a
midshipman's commission, and joined his father's
ship. Captain Perry was an officer of spirit and
enterprise, and Oliver saw some real, if not warlike,
service in the General Greene.</p>

<p>His next cruise was in the Adams, frigate,
which was sent out in 1802 to join Commodore
Morris's squadron at Gibraltar. The orders of
the squadron were to watch the ships of the
Barbary powers, and to prevent as far as possible
their aggressions upon American commerce.
This was hard and thankless work, and most of
the younger officers who made the Mediterranean
cruise in 1802-3 considered themselves as peculiarly
unfortunate, as they were generally ordered
to return to the United States just at the time
that the active hostilities began, in which their
successors reaped so much glory. Perry was one
of those who made the uneventful cruise of 1802.
He enjoyed great advantages, though, in sailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>on a ship of which Isaac Hull, afterward the celebrated
commodore, was first lieutenant. Hull's
admirable seamanship in navigating the narrow
straits of Gibraltar in all weathers, and the blockading
of Tripoli for eight months during an inclement
season, upon a dangerous coast, without
pilots and with insufficient charts, was a subject
of general commendation from the officers of the
squadron. Perry improved his opportunities so
well that he was given an appointment as acting
lieutenant the day he was seventeen years
old. It is believed that this is the most
rapid instance of promotion in the American
navy.</p>

<p>Perry returned home in the Adams in the
autumn of 1803. The next summer it was
known that a determined attempt would be made
by Preble's squadron to reduce the Barbary
powers, and Perry was extremely anxious to be
on the scene of action. He found himself ordered
to the Constellation, in the squadron under Commodore
Barron which was sent out to assist
Preble; but the Constellation and the President,
forty-four guns, did not reach Tripoli until
Preble had practically completed the work.
Perry remained in the Constellation several
months; but as she was too large to be of much
service on that coast, Perry thought himself fortunate
to be ordered to the schooner Nautilus,
of fourteen guns, as first lieutenant. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>his first duty in that responsible capacity, and he
acquitted himself well, although only twenty years
old. He had a beautiful and penetrating voice,
and this, in addition to his other qualifications,
made him a brilliant deck officer.</p>

<p>He took part in the operations off Derne, and
was highly commended for his conduct. In the
autumn of 1806 he returned home, and served at
home stations until 1809, when he got his first
command. This was a smart little schooner, the
Revenge, of fourteen guns.</p>

<p>At that time the occurrences which led to the
war of 1812-15 were taking place, and Perry
soon had a chance to show his determination to
maintain the dignity of the flag he flew. An
American vessel had been run away with by the
English captain who commanded her and who
had hoisted British colors over her. Perry determined
to take possession of her, although two
small British cruisers lay near her. This he did,
supported by three gunboats. The British
cruisers, appreciating the justice of his conduct,
did not interfere, although Perry had no means of
knowing whether they would or not and took all
the chances. As he was carrying the vessel off,
he was met by a British sloop-of-war, and her
captain sent a boat, with a request that Perry
should come aboard. This Perry flatly refused,
and, determined that his ship should not be caught
unprepared as the Leopard caught the Chesapeake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>in 1807,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> he sent his men to quarters,
and made every preparation to resist; but the
British ship passed on, and no collision occurred.
In January, 1811, Perry had the misfortune to
lose the Revenge by shipwreck off Watch Hill,
in Rhode Island; but the court of inquiry which
investigated it acquitted him of blame, and
praised his conduct at the time of the accident.</p>

<p>When war was declared with Great Britain,
Perry was in command of a division of gunboats
at Newport; but finding there was little chance
of seeing active service in that duty, he asked to
be sent to the lakes, where Commodore Chauncey
was preparing to dispute the possession of those
great inland seas with the British.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1813 Perry arrived at Lake
Erie, and entered upon his duties. The small fleet
to oppose the British had to be constructed in
the wilderness, on the shores of the lake; and
men and material had to be transported at great
labor and cost from the seaboard.</p>

<p>Perry showed the utmost skill, energy, and vigilance
in his arduous work, and built and equipped
his little squadron in a manner most creditable to
himself and his subordinates.</p>

<p>The land forces, operating together with the
seamen and marines, got command of the Niagara
River; but a little British squadron guarded the
mouth of the river, at which there was a bar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>which it was thought unlikely the Americans
could pass and so get into the lake itself. Perry,
however, watched his chance, and on a Sunday
afternoon in August, 1813, to his surprise, he
found the British squadron had disappeared. It
was said that the British commander, Barclay,
had gone over to the Canadian side to attend a
dinner, thinking the Americans could not possibly
get over the bar before his return. But Perry and
his officers and men went to work, and by the
most arduous labor they got all the vessels into
the lake before Captain Barclay returned. Once
in the lake, the Americans were much stronger
than the British, and Perry determined to go in
search of the enemy. He had much sickness on
his little squadron, and was ill himself, so that it
was not until early in September that he was prepared
to fight. Meanwhile the British, although
having only six vessels to oppose to Perry's nine,
undauntedly sought the conflict, and on the morning
of the 10th of September, while Perry was in
Put-in-Bay, he saw the little British squadron
standing in the offing. Perry had two brigs,
the Lawrence,&mdash;his own flagship, named for
the brave Lawrence,&mdash;and the Niagara, each of
which carried twenty guns; and he had five
smaller vessels. Captain Barclay had the Detroit,&mdash;his
flagship, of nineteen guns,&mdash;the Queen
Charlotte, of seventeen guns, and four smaller
vessels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>The wind was light and variable, so that the
American vessels came out slowly; but the little
British squadron waited with their topsails to the
mast, until a quarter to twelve, when the first
shot was fired by the Detroit. In a very little
while the action became general, each American
and British vessel bravely doing its best to get
alongside its enemy. It was the effort of the
gallant commanders of the American and British
squadrons to fight flagship to flagship; and in
doing this, Perry, in the Lawrence, drew ahead of
his column, and concentrated upon his ship the
fire from the Detroit and two other vessels. The
British fought their batteries with unusual skill,
and the result soon was that a dreadful slaughter
took place on the Lawrence's decks, her guns
were silenced, and she was so much cut up that
she was totally unmanageable. But Perry, with
indomitable courage, continued the fight. He
himself, with the help of the purser and the chaplain,
fired the last gun available on the Lawrence.
Her consort, the Niagara, approached about this
time, the wind sprang up, and Perry, seeing that
the battle was passing ahead of him, determined
to abandon his own unfortunate ship and make
for the Niagara. He ordered a boat lowered,
and, taking with him his brother, a little midshipman
of thirteen years old, he was rapidly pulled
to the Niagara. Once on board of her, he bore
up, and soon got her into a position to rake both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>the Detroit and the Queen Charlotte with fearful
effect. These two vessels, after an heroic defence,
were compelled to strike, while the seven smaller
American gunboats soon overpowered the four
British ones. The Detroit, however, before striking
had forced the Lawrence to haul down her
colors; and the fight, as all the others during this
war, was as creditable to British as to American
valor.</p>

<p>The first news of the victory was in Perry's
celebrated despatch: "We have met the enemy,
and they are ours." The news from the Canadian
border had not always been gratifying, and on
that account the American people were the more
delighted at this success. Perry was given a
gold medal and promoted to be a post-captain;
for although he had been called commodore by
courtesy, such was not his real rank at the
time.</p>

<p>Perry had no further opportunity of distinguishing
himself before peace was declared, in January,
1815. He obtained afterward some of the best
commands in the navy, and in March, 1819, he
became a commodore in fact, by being given the
command of a squadron in South America destined
to protect American trade in those quarters.
He hoisted his broad pennant on the John
Adams, and sailed in June. He reached the
mouth of the Orinoco River in August, and, although
it was in the midst of the sickly season,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>he determined to go up the river to Angostura.
He shifted his flag to the Nonesuch, schooner,
and sent the frigate to Trinidad.</p>

<p>After reaching Angostura he remained twenty
days. Yellow fever was raging, and Perry seems
to have been singularly indifferent to this fact.
Fever broke out on the schooner, and it was then
determined to get back to the sea as soon as possible.
As they dropped down the river with the
powerful current two days after leaving Angostura,
Perry got into his gig, and amused himself
shooting wildfowl on the banks. He was exposed
to the sun, and that night, after going aboard the
schooner, which was anchored on the bar at the
mouth of the river, the weather grew bad, with a
heavy sea, which washed over the side and leaked
down into Perry's cabin, drenching him. Next
morning he was very ill.</p>

<p>From the first he felt that he should not recover,
and, although calmly preparing for death,
spoke often of his young wife and little children
at home. He was very anxious to live until the
schooner could reach Trinidad and he could, at
least, die upon his ship. At last, on the 23d of
August, the Nonesuch reached Port Spain, Trinidad,
where the John Adams was at anchor. A
boat put off at once from the frigate carrying
the first lieutenant and other officers, in response
to the signal from the schooner. They found
Perry in the agonies of death on the floor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>the little cabin. He survived long enough to
show satisfaction at seeing them, and asked feebly
about the ship; but in a little while the anxious
watchers on the frigate saw the flag on the
Nonesuch slowly half-masted,&mdash;Perry was no
more.</p>

<p>He was buried at Trinidad with full military
honors. Some years afterward a ship of war was
sent by the government to bring back his remains
to his native country. He sleeps at Newport,
Rhode Island, near the spot where he was born;
and the reputation he left behind him is that of
a gallant, capable, and devoted officer.</p>

<h2>THOMAS MACDONOUGH.</h2>


<p>Thomas Macdonough may be called the Young
Commodore; for he was an acting commodore at
the age of thirty-one, when the modern naval
officer is still in subordinate grades of rank. It
is truly astonishing what wonders were accomplished
by men in their first manhood in the
early days of the American navy, and Macdonough
had seen as much service as most veterans before
his twenty-first birthday. He was a son of a
Revolutionary officer, and was born in Delaware
in 1783. His diffident and retiring disposition
was early marked. Fenimore Cooper speaks of
him in his midshipman days as "the modest but
lion-hearted Macdonough." The words describe
him admirably; for this quiet, silent midshipman
was always to be found leading the forlorn hope,&mdash;"the
lost children," as the French expressively
call it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_216"></a>
<img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="400" height="518" alt="Thomas Macdonough" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thomas Macdonough</span></span>
</div>

<p>Indeed, Macdonough's character as an officer
and a man is as nearly perfect as can be imagined;
and when his great talents are considered,
he may well be held as a type of what the American
naval officer should be. He entered the
navy in 1800, when he was seventeen, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>rather old for a midshipman in those days. He
had enjoyed a good education for his years, and
remained a close student all his life. He was
deeply but not obtrusively religious, and no human
being ever heard a low or profane word
from his lips.</p>

<p>Such a young man as Thomas Macdonough
must make his mark early, and from the first his
commanding officers reposed the greatest confidence
in him. He was ordered to the Philadelphia,
under Captain Bainbridge, when Commodore
Preble went out in 1803 to reduce the African
pirates. He happened to have been detached
from the Philadelphia and in command of a
prize at Gibraltar when the unfortunate ship went
upon the rocks near Tripoli, October 31, 1803,
and he thus escaped the long captivity of his
shipmates. He reported promptly to Commodore
Preble, and was assigned to the Enterprise,
schooner, under Decatur, then a young lieutenant
commandant of less than twenty-five years. It
may be imagined that no officer in the Mediterranean
squadron felt a more ardent desire than
Macdonough to rescue Bainbridge and his men
and to destroy the Philadelphia.</p>

<p>At last Decatur organized his celebrated expedition
in the ketch Intrepid, and among the
eleven officers he selected for that glorious enterprise
was Macdonough. At that time Macdonough
was still a midshipman. He was tall and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>slender, never having been physically strong; but
he was, even then, a man for the post of danger.</p>

<p>The ketch set off on the 3d of February from
Syracuse and returned on the 19th, having in
that time entered the well-guarded harbor of
Tripoli by night, burned the Philadelphia at
her moorings, and escaped without losing a man.
Macdonough was the third man on the Philadelphia's
deck, and was especially active in his
work of distributing the powder for the ship's
destruction in her storerooms aft. No officer in
that glorious expedition conducted himself better
than Macdonough; and when it is remembered
that Decatur commanded it, that James Lawrence
was one of his lieutenants, and Charles Morris,
who was afterward Captain Hull's first lieutenant
in the escape of the Constitution and the capture
of the Guerrière, was one of the midshipmen, it
will be seen that Macdonough was measured by
no common standard.</p>

<p>Macdonough shared in all the glory of those
splendid campaigns, and received the thanks and
commendations of his superiors, besides promotion.
In 1806 he was made first lieutenant of the
Siren, one of the smart brigs that had done
good service during the Tripolitan war. She was
at Gibraltar, where the British navy is always
very much in evidence; and Macdonough, the mild
and forbearing, soon had a chance of showing the
stuff that was in him. One day, while his commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>officer, Captain Smith, was on shore,
Macdonough noticed a boat going from a heavy
British frigate that lay close to an American
merchant vessel. When the boat repassed the
Siren, on her way back to the frigate, she carried
one more man than she had on leaving the
frigate. In those days, if a British captain suspected
an American merchant vessel of having a
British subject among the crew, it was common
enough to seize the man, and when once on board
a British ship, it mattered little whether he were
American or British, there he had to stay. Macdonough
suspected this to be the case, and sent
a boat to the brig to ask if a man had been
taken and if he were an American. Such was
actually reported. Macdonough at once ordered
the first cutter lowered, and although she pulled
only four oars and the British boat pulled eight,
he set off in pursuit. He did not catch up with
the British boat until she was directly under the
frigate's quarter, and the man in the bow had
raised his boat-hook. Suddenly Macdonough
reached forward, and, catching hold of the prisoner,
who sat in the stern sheets, lifted him
bodily into the American boat, and before the
British could believe their eyes, was well started
on his way back to the Siren.</p>

<p>The captain of the frigate had seen the whole
affair, and in a rage he jumped into a boat and
headed for the Siren. When he reached her the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>men of the cutter had gone aboard, and the
young lieutenant was calmly walking the quarterdeck.
The captain angrily demanded the man,
and asked if Macdonough knew the responsibility
he was taking upon himself in Captain Smith's
absence.</p>

<p>"I will not give up the man, and I am accountable
only to the captain of this ship," replied
Macdonough.</p>

<p>"I could blow you out of the water at this
moment," said the captain.</p>

<p>"No doubt you are perfectly able to do it," answered
Macdonough; "but I will never give up
that man as long as this ship will float."</p>

<p>"You are a very indiscreet and a very young
man," continued the captain. "Suppose I had
been in the boat just now?"</p>

<p>"I would have taken the man or lost my life."</p>

<p>"What, sir!" cried the captain; "would you
dare to stop me now if I were to get hold of the
man?"</p>

<p>"I would, and you have only to try it," was
Macdonough's undaunted reply.</p>

<p>The captain, seeing nothing was to be got out
of the resolute young lieutenant, left the ship,
but was pulled toward the merchant ship. Macdonough
had a boat lowered which followed the
British boat, watching her until she returned to
the frigate. This action not only won the good
opinion of the captain and other officers and men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>of the Siren, but of many of the British officers
as well, who knew how to respect a man of such
resolute courage.</p>

<p>Macdonough was ever afterward treated with
the utmost consideration and politeness by all the
British officers at Gibraltar, including the officers
of the overbearing captain.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war with Great Britain
Macdonough was what was then termed a master
commandant. His was not the fortune of Decatur,
Stewart, and others of his brave shipmates
to seek for glory on the wide ocean, but he was
sent into the wilderness, as it were, to create a
navy, and to fight the British on the great lakes.
He established himself with his seamen and workmen
on the shores of Lake Champlain, and began
immediately the construction of a fleet.
Officers and men worked with the greatest ardor,
and the commodore, as Macdonough was now
called by courtesy, might often have been seen
handling the saw and plane. A corvette, called
the Saratoga, and meant for the commodore's
flagship, was begun, with several smaller vessels;
and so rapidly did they advance that only a few
weeks from the time the trees were cut down in
the forest the vessels were launched and being
made ready for their guns. These had to be
dragged many hundreds of miles through a pathless
wilderness, such as the northern and western
part of New York was then. It was difficult, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>still it could be done. When it came to transporting
the cables, though, a point was reached,
about forty miles from the lake shore where the
vessels were building, when it seemed impossible
to move a step farther. There were no roads,
and the cables had been brought in ox-wagons,
which now came to a complete standstill. No
one knew what to do until an old sailor proposed
that they should stretch each cable its whole
length, and men, stationed ten yards apart, should
shoulder it and carry it the forty miles remaining;
and this was actually done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British had not been idle, and
they too, on the other side of the lake, had built
a frigate, called the Confiance, that was heavier
than the Saratoga, and they had other smaller
vessels. Their commanding officer, Captain
Downie, was a worthy antagonist of Commodore
Macdonough, and about the same age, while the
British vessels were manned by seasoned sailors,
many of whom had served under Nelson and
Collingwood.</p>

<p>Early in September, 1814, both squadrons being
ready to fight, Commodore Macdonough chose his
position with a seaman's eye, in Plattsburg bay.
He knew that his enemy would hunt for him
wherever he might be, and he chose to fight
at anchor, rightly supposing that the British,
through their greater experience, could conduct
the evolutions of a squadron better than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>Americans; for, while none could be more daring
in action than Macdonough, none was more
prudent beforehand. The exact knowledge he
had of the elements for and against him explains
much of his success.</p>

<p>On the night of the 9th of September, in the
midst of storm and tempest, the American squadron
made its way up the lake to Plattsburg harbor.
The next morning saw it anchored in the
admirable order devised by Commodore Macdonough's
genius. The flagship, Saratoga, the
heaviest ship in the squadron, was in the middle
of the line. Ahead of her was ranged the gun-brig
Eagle, commanded by Captain Cassin, who
had been one of Commodore Preble's midshipmen
with Macdonough, eleven years before. The
Eagle had shoal water off her beam, so that the
head of the line could not be turned. On the
other side of the Saratoga was the Ticonderoga,
a small sloop-of-war, while beyond her was the
little Preble, named for the great commodore,
who was no more. There were, besides, ten
small gunboats, of which the Eagle was supported
by two, the Saratoga by three, the Ticonderoga
by two, while the remaining two were to
assist the Preble in defending the end of the line.
All of the vessels were riding easily at anchor,
and all of them were provided with springs to
their anchors and kedges, to enable them to
change their position at will. The wisdom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>this precaution was shown on the great day for
which they were prepared.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September, 1814, a brilliant
Sunday morning, just at sunrise, the dazzling
white topsails of the British fleet were seen passing
along the neck of land called Cumberland
Head, which juts into the bay. The American
guard-boat pulled in, all hands were called to
quarters in the American squadron, and an American
ensign was set at every masthead. Then on
board the flagship was made the signal for divine
service, and Commodore Macdonough, kneeling
upon his quarterdeck, surrounded by his officers
and in hearing of his men, with every head bared,
read the prayers appointed to be read before a fight
at sea. After this brief but solemn act all awaited
the onset with steadiness and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>It had been suggested to him that he should
issue an extra allowance of grog to the men, but
he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. My men shall go cool into action; they
need no stimulant beyond their native valor."</p>

<p>The American vessels were so skilfully moored
that no matter from what quarter the wind was,
the British were obliged to approach them "bows
on," a very dangerous way to attack a bold and
skilful enemy.</p>

<p>The British rounded the headland in noble
style. The Confiance was leading, her brave
commander, Captain Downie, fatally conspicuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>on her deck, his breast covered with medals
gloriously earned. Following her, came three
smaller vessels, the Finch, the Chubb, and the
Linnet, and twelve gunboats, carrying both soldiers
and sailors, and each armed with a single
long eighteen-pound carronade.</p>

<p>As the four British ships, each on the same
tack, neared the American line, the Eagle suddenly
roared out a broadside. The shot fell
short, and the British squadron came on, with
majestic steadiness, without replying, until the
Linnet was abreast of the Ticonderoga. Then
the Linnet let fly a broadside, of which every
shot dropped into the water except one. This
one shot, though, struck a chicken-coop on the
Ticonderoga's deck and smashed it, letting out
a young game-cock, a pet with the Ticonderoga's
men. The game-cock, delighted to get his
liberty, jumped upon a gun-slide and uttered
a long, loud, and defiant crow at the British
vessel, which he seemed to think had directed
her whole broadside at him. The Americans
burst into three ringing cheers, that shook the
deck, delighted with the game-cock's courage,
which he proved further by flying up into the
rigging and crowing vociferously all the time the
British were advancing.</p>

<p>The Confiance came on steadily until just
abreast of the Saratoga, when Commodore Macdonough
himself, sighting a twenty-four pounder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>fired the first effective gun of the battle. It struck
the Confiance near the hawse-hole, and ranged the
whole length of her deck, doing fearful damage
and splintering her wheel. A terrible broadside
followed; but the Confiance as if disdaining
to answer, moved proudly on to engage at
close quarters, and not until the wind became
light and baffling did she port her helm about two
cables' length from the Saratoga. Then she
opened upon the corvette. Her guns were double-shotted,
and their effect at close range, in a perfectly
smooth sea, was frightful. Meanwhile the
Linnet and the Chubb had taken position abeam
of the Eagle, and attacked her with great fury.
The gunboats had fallen upon the little Preble,
and soon drove her out of line, when with the
Finch they concentrated their fire upon the Ticonderoga.
The gallant little brig gave them
plenty to do, and stubbornly defended the end
of the line. At one moment the gunboats would
advance upon her, the men standing up ready
to board her, and would be beaten off in the
act of entering her ports or springing upon her
decks. Then they would haul off and pour round
after round of grapeshot into her. Still the little
vessel held out. Captain Cassin was seen coolly
walking the taffrail, a target for every shot, but
he escaped without a wound, as if by a miracle.
At one time all the matches gave out in the division
of guns commanded by midshipman Paulding.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>This young officer, who was an acting lieutenant,
although only sixteen years old, had the
wit and readiness to fire his guns by snapping his
pistol at the touch-hole.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the determined valor with
which the Saratoga and the Confiance kept up
the fight. The Linnet presently turned her
attention to the Saratoga, and poured one raking
broadside into her after another, besides
what she had to take from the Confiance. The
brave Captain Downie had been mortally wounded
early in the engagement, but the ship was still
admirably fought. On the Saratoga three times
the cry went up that Commodore Macdonough
was killed, for three times was he knocked
senseless to the deck; but each time he rose,
none the worse except for a few cuts and
bruises.</p>

<p>The guns on the engaged side of the Saratoga
became disabled one by one, by the long
twenty-fours in the main-deck battery of the
Confiance, which, though suffering from the
musketry fire of the Americans, was yet doing
magnificent work. At last but a single gun of
the starboard batteries of the Saratoga remained
serviceable, and in firing it the bolt broke, the
gun flew off the carriage, and actually tumbled
down the hatchway.</p>

<p>The ship was afire in several places, due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>hot shot poured into her by the Confiance, one-fourth
of her men were killed, and she had not a
gun available on her engaged side; while both
the Confiance and the Linnet were giving her
one raking broadside after another. In this
awful extremity Commodore Macdonough determined
to wind his ship, which means to turn
the ship completely around so that she could use
her uninjured batteries. This difficult but brilliant
man&oelig;uvre was executed with the utmost
coolness, and soon she sprung a new broadside
on the Confiance. The Confiance attempted
the same man&oelig;uvre, but she only got partly
round, when she hung with her head to the
wind, in a terrible position, where the fresh batteries
of the Saratoga raked her fore and aft.
No ship could stand this long and live; and after
two hours of as desperate fighting as was ever
seen, the Confiance was forced to haul down
her colors.</p>

<p>By that time the Finch had been driven out
of the fight, and the Chubb had been shot
wholly to pieces. The little Linnet, though,
alone and single-handed, undauntedly sustained
the fight, hoping that some of the gunboats
might be able to tow her off. But when the
Saratoga had finished with the Confiance, without
a moment's loss of time, she turned her
broadside on the Linnet, and soon forced her to
strike, with her hull riddled like a sieve, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>masts gone, and the water a foot deep in her
hold. By midday all was over, and of the sixteen
British ensigns that had fluttered proudly in
the morning air, not one remained. It was one
of the most destructive naval engagements ever
fought. In Commodore Macdonough's official
report, he says there was not a mast left in either
squadron on which sail could be made. Some of
the British sailors had been at Trafalgar, and they
all agreed that the fighting of that 11th of September
had been more severe than at Trafalgar.</p>

<p>The American sailors fought with extraordinary
coolness, and many amusing as well as
terrible and inspiring things occurred. One old
sailor on the Saratoga, who had worked and fought
all during the battle and had been slightly wounded
several times, was seen mopping his face delightedly
while calling out to one of his messmates,
"Ay, Jack, this is the best fun I've had this war."</p>

<p>Another, getting a shot through his glazed hat,
took it off, and, turning to an officer, said in a
tone of bitter complaint, "Look a-here, sir; them
Johnny Bulls has spiled my hat. Now, what am
I going to do for a hat?"</p>

<p>As soon as the Linnet struck, the British
officers, led by Captain Pring, who succeeded
Captain Downie in command, came aboard the
Saratoga to deliver their swords. All the American
officers were assembled on her quarterdeck,
and as the British officers approached Commodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>Macdonough with their swords extended,
he said, with deep feeling,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, your gallant conduct makes you
the more worthy to wear your swords. Return
them to their scabbards."</p>

<p>At once every attention was given the wounded,
the officers working side by side with the men.
Captain Pring, in his report, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have much satisfaction in making you acquainted
with the humane treatment the wounded
have received from Commodore Macdonough.
They were immediately removed to his own hospital
at Crab Island, and furnished with every
requisite. His generous and polite attention to
myself, the officers, and men, will ever be gratefully
remembered." All this was quite characteristic
of Macdonough, who united the tenderness
of a woman with a lion-like courage.</p>

<p>The night of the battle the commodore visited
every ship in the squadron, and personally expressed
to the officers and men his appreciation
of their gallant services that day.</p>

<p>The news of the victory was received all over
the country with manifestations of joy. Congress
passed the usual resolution of thanks to Macdonough,
his officers and men, gave him and
his two commanding officers gold medals, silver
medals to the lieutenants, and a handsome sword
to each of the midshipmen, with a liberal award
of prize money to the men. Macdonough was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>made a post-captain, his commission dating from
the day of the battle.</p>

<p>The State of Vermont gave him an estate overlooking
the scene of his victory, and many States
and towns made him presents. Macdonough bore
all these honors with characteristic modesty and
simplicity, and, instead of being elated by them,
tears came into his eyes in speaking of what his
country had bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Soon after this peace was declared, and Macdonough
returned again to service on the ocean.
His health had always been delicate, and as years
passed on, it grew more so. But he continued to go
to sea, and did his full duty as always. In 1825
he was in command of the glorious old Constitution,
as his flagship on the Mediterranean
station. She had been splendidly refitted, sailed
admirably, both on and off the wind, and, as the
sailors said, "looked like a new fiddle." He
made his last cruise in this noble ship. His
health rapidly declined, and on his way home
from the Mediterranean he died and was buried
at sea on the 10th of November, 1825.</p>

<p>Few men have enjoyed more national esteem
and affection than Macdonough. His career
shows that a man may have the softest manners
and mildest disposition along with an invincible
courage and a high spirit. Macdonough may be
taken as the type of a great seaman and a pure
and perfect man.</p>

<h2>JAMES LAWRENCE.</h2>


<p>The name of Lawrence, like that of Somers,
is associated with youth, with gallantry, and with
misfortune. It was his fate, after many brilliant
and heroic successes, to lay down his life and lose
his ship; but his colors were hauled down, not by
himself, but by the enemy, and his last utterance,
"Don't give up the ship," which has become the
watchword of the American navy, was literally
obeyed. It is remarkable that this unfortunate
vessel, the Chesapeake, never was formally surrendered,
but was taken possession of and her
flag struck by her captors.</p>

<p>James Lawrence was born in Burlington, New
Jersey, in 1781. His family were persons of
consideration and property, and Lawrence was
destined to be a lawyer. He was a remarkably
handsome, gentle, and docile boy, and it was a
surprise to his family when, at twelve years of
age, he developed a passionate desire to enter the
newly created navy. He never wavered from this
wish, but, being a singularly obedient boy, he
agreed to try the study of the law for a time, and
applied himself seriously to it for a year or two.
In 1798, however, when he was in his eighteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>year, and when his natural bent was fully indicated,
his inclination toward the navy became
overpowering. His family wisely released him
from the law, which was so distasteful to him,
and got him a midshipman's warrant in the navy.</p>

<p>His first service was in the Ganges, a small
twenty-four-gun frigate. At the time of his
entrance into the navy he was of a noble and
commanding figure, of captivating manners, and
although somewhat impatient in temper, at heart
entirely amiable and generous. From the beginning
he was remarkable for his kindness and
consideration toward his inferiors. When it was
necessary to punish the sailors, and Lawrence
had to superintend the punishment, his eyes
would fill with tears; and when he became a
lieutenant, his popularity with the midshipmen
was unbounded. It is told of him that once
the midshipmen in Commodore Rodgers's squadron
determined to give the commodore a dinner,
to which none of the lieutenants were to be invited.
All were agreed to leave out the lieutenants,
when one of the midshipmen cried, "What!
not ask Mr. Lawrence!" The impossibility of
leaving Lawrence out seemed patent to all of
them; and to make the compliment more marked,
he was the only lieutenant asked to meet the
commodore.</p>

<p>Lawrence's first service in the Ganges was
during the troubles with France. The Ganges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>patrolled the seas, and caught several French
privateers which made a good resistance, but
never got alongside a vessel of equal force.</p>

<p>In 1802 Lawrence went out to the Mediterranean
in the Enterprise, as first lieutenant.
This gallant little schooner fully sustained her
reputation in the operations of Commodore
Morris's squadron, which preceded Commodore
Preble's by a year. Although the war had just
begun, and had not yet assumed the fierce and
determined character of the following year,
yet the Bashaw had a foretaste in 1803 of what
was to befall him in the way of bombardments
and boat attacks in 1804. In one of the boat
attacks Lawrence volunteered, and his conduct
on the occasion won high praise.</p>

<p>The force was under the command of Lieutenant
David Porter, first lieutenant of the New
York, flagship, who had already distinguished
himself against the French, and was destined to
make one of the most daring cruises in the history
of navies.</p>

<p>The New York, with the Adams, frigate, and
the little Enterprise, began the blockade of
Tripoli in May, 1803. A number of merchant
vessels, protected by gunboats, ran under the
batteries of the old part of the town, where they
were comparatively safe from ships of the draught
of the American squadron. Every preparation
was made to defend them, but Porter, Lawrence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>and other brave and daring young spirits determined
to make a dash for them and destroy them
if possible. Having got the commodore's permission,
an attacking party was organized under
Porter, with Lawrence as second in command,
with three other officers and a number of picked
men. On the morning of the attack the boats
advanced boldly, in the face of a sharp musketry
fire, and succeeded in making a landing. The
Tripolitans adopted their usual style of hand-to-hand
fighting, but in spite of it the vessels were
fired and the Americans retired with slight loss.
The Tripolitans, by the most tremendous efforts,
put out the fire and saved their vessels; but they
discovered that the Americans were disposed to
come to close quarters with them, which policy
finally brought down the power of the Barbary
States.</p>

<p>Lawrence, as well as Porter, was particularly
distinguished in this dashing little affair. The
next adventure in which Lawrence was engaged
was a few weeks after; the Enterprise being
under the command of Hull, then a lieutenant
commandant. It had been determined to hunt
up the Tripolitan ships of war wherever found.
The Enterprise was engaged in this service,
and on a June morning, very early, the lookouts
from the Adams, frigate, observed a signal flying
from the Enterprise of "Enemy in sight." A
Tripolitan frigate, supported by nine gunboats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>trying to get to sea from Tripoli, had been penned
up in a narrow bay by the Enterprise, which,
too weak to attack, signalled for her more powerful
consort to come to her assistance. The
Adams responded promptly, the Enterprise meanwhile
maintaining her station with as much daring
as if she were a forty-four-gun frigate instead
of a twelve-gun schooner. As soon as the wind
permitted the Adams to get within range, she
opened with terrible effect upon the corsair,
which replied vigorously, and did not strike until
she had received the fire of the Adams, in smooth
water and at short range, for three quarters of an
hour. Soon after her colors were hauled down,
fire reached her magazine, and she blew up.</p>

<p>It was Lawrence's extreme good fortune, after
serving under such a captain as Isaac Hull,
to serve next under Decatur. The Argus, one
of the four handsome little vessels built for the
war with Tripoli, had been sent out under Decatur,
who was to exchange her for the Enterprise, Hull's
superior rank entitling him to the larger vessel.
Yet it is remarkable that the little Enterprise,
although distinctly inferior to the other four small
vessels, survived every one of them, and had an
unbroken career of success both in running and
fighting.</p>

<p>As soon as Decatur took the Enterprise, and
had got a good look at Tripoli on the reconnoitring
expedition made by Commodore Preble in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>the early winter of 1803, the idea of the destruction
of the Philadelphia and the release of Bainbridge
and his companions possessed his mind.
It may be imagined that Lawrence ardently sympathized
with him, and in his young first lieutenant
Decatur recognized a daring and steadfast
spirit akin to his own. It was Decatur's habit, in
speaking of Lawrence, to say, "He has no more
dodge in him than the mainmast," which was
true.</p>

<p>In the same month of December the Enterprise
captured the ketch Meshouda, which, renamed
the Intrepid, was to take part in one of
the most glorious successes, and afterward in
one of the most heart-breaking tragedies, of the
American navy.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the ketch, and in working
out the details of his plan, Decatur was ably
seconded by his first lieutenant. The expedition
for the destruction of the Philadelphia was exactly
suited to a man of Lawrence's vigorous and
imaginative temperament.</p>

<p>If a precise record remained of that immortal
expedition,&mdash;the six days of storm and tempest,
in which the ketch, ill ventilated and crowded with
men who were wet to the skin most of the time
and half starved because their provisions were
spoiled by salt water, was blown about the African
coast,&mdash;how surpassingly interesting it would be!
It is known, however, that both officers and men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>not only kept up their determination, but their
gayety. On that February evening when the
ketch stole in and made fast to the Philadelphia
to destroy her, Lawrence, next to Decatur,
bore the most active part. It was he who commanded
the boat that put out from the ketch
and coolly fastened a hawser to the forechains
of the doomed frigate; and it was he who intercepted
the frigate's boat and took the fast
from it and passed another line from the Philadelphia's
stern into the ketch. When Decatur
shouted, "Board!" Lawrence was among the first
to land on the quarterdeck, and as soon as that
was cleared, he dashed below, accompanied by
two midshipmen, as intrepid as himself,&mdash;Mr.
Laws and the indomitable Macdonough,&mdash;with
ten men, and fired the berth-deck and all the
forward storerooms. Nothing is more extraordinary
than the quickness and precision with
which every order was carried out on that night
of glory. Lawrence and his party were in the
ship less than twenty-five minutes, yet they were
the last to drop into the ketch.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> On their return
after this celebrated adventure, Lawrence received
his due share of praise.</p>

<p>There was much hard work to be done by every
officer in the squadron before it was ready to
attack Tripoli in August, 1804, and Lawrence, as
first lieutenant, did his part. Once before Tripoli,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>there was severe fighting as well as hard work.
The fact that Decatur was taken out of his ship
so often to lead a division of the boats, left the
command of the Enterprise much to Lawrence,
and he handled the little schooner in the most
seamanlike manner.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1804-5 the government determined
to build a number of small gunboats, to
renew the attacks on Tripoli in the summer.
Some of the lieutenants who had returned to
the United States in the changes necessary in the
squadron, were selected to take them out to the
Mediterranean. Lawrence, who had come back
to the United States after spending two years in
the Mediterranean, was given the command of
one of these little vessels, Number Six,&mdash;for they
were thought to be too insignificant to name and
consequently were merely numbered. They carried
a large spread of canvas, but their gunwales
were so near the water that they looked rather
like rafts than boats. On the way over,
Lawrence was sighted by the British frigate
Lapwing, which sent a boat to rescue them, supposing
them to be on a raft after a shipwreck.
Lawrence thanked the officer in charge of the
boat, but proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>Commodore Rodgers was then in command of
the American force which again appeared before
Tripoli in May, 1805; and without firing a gun
a treaty of peace and the release of the Philadelphia's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>officers and men were secured. The
squadron then sailed for Tunis, where it intimidated
the Tunisians into good behavior and
negotiated a treaty of peace under the threat of
a bombardment.</p>

<p>Soon after most of the vessels returned home.
Lawrence recrossed the ocean again in his gunboat,
and commanded her for some time after.</p>

<p>On the 22d of June, 1807, occurred the painful
and mortifying rencounter of the Chesapeake,
frigate, with the British frigate Leopard,
one of the most far-reaching events in the
American navy. As the name of Lawrence will
ever be connected with the unfortunate Chesapeake,
the story of that unhappy event can be
told here.</p>

<p>The Chesapeake was a comparatively new
ship, carrying thirty-eight guns, and was put
in commission to relieve the Constitution in the
Mediterranean. She seems to have been an
unpopular ship from the first, as she was thought
to be weak for her size, and was a very ordinary
sailer. She was to wear the broad pennant of
Commodore James Barron, who had Captain
Gordon as his flag captain. Both of these men
were esteemed excellent officers.</p>

<p>The Chesapeake was fitted partly at the
Washington Navy Yard and partly at the Norfolk
Navy Yard. There had been a charge that she
had among her crew three deserters from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>British frigate Melampus. The charge had been
investigated, however, and found to be a mistake.
It was known that the Leopard, of fifty
guns, was hanging about outside the capes of
Virginia, but it was not suspected that she would
attempt to stop the Chesapeake. The British
government, arrogant in its dominion over the
sea, had claimed and exercised the right of
searching merchant vessels; and the United
States, a young nation, with a central government
which was still an experiment as well
as an object of jealousy to the State governments,
had submitted from not knowing exactly
how to resist. But with a ship of war it was
different, and neither the authorities nor the
people of the United States dreamed that any
attempt would be made to violate the deck of a
national vessel.</p>

<p>There seems to have been great negligence in
preparing the Chesapeake for sea, and when she
sailed she was in a state of confusion, her decks
littered up, and none of the apparatus used in
those days for firing great guns was available.
Neither was her crew drilled, having been at
quarters only three times. Her officers were
men of spirit, but there seems to have been a
fatal laxness in getting her ready for sea.</p>

<p>The Chesapeake, with a good wind, dropped
down to Hampton Roads, and was soon stretching
out to sea. About noon the Leopard was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>discerned, and from the first seemed to be following
the Chesapeake. At three o'clock the
two, still making for the open ocean, were near
enough to speak, and the Leopard hailed, saying
she had despatches for Commodore Barron.
This was not remarkable, as such courtesies
were occasionally exchanged between ships of
friendly nations. The Chesapeake hove to, as
did the Leopard, close to each other, when the
Chesapeake's officers noticed that the British
frigate had her guns run out, and was evidently
perfectly ready for action. Very soon a boat
put off from her, and a lieutenant came aboard
the Chesapeake. He went below into the great
cabin, and handed Commodore Barron a letter
from Vice-Admiral Berkley, dated at Halifax,
directing him on meeting the Chesapeake to
search her for the three alleged deserters, and
offering to allow the Leopard to be searched if
desired.</p>

<p>Commodore Barron was a brave man and a
good officer in general, but he appears to have
been seized with one of those moments of indecision
which in a few minutes can wreck a
whole life. It is difficult, though, to imagine
how one could act judiciously in an emergency
so terrible, when the choice lies between submitting
to a frightful insult and provoking a
conflict which must result in the loss of many
gallant and innocent men. The commodore's real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>fault was in going to sea in an unprepared
condition.</p>

<p>Commodore Barron took about half an hour to
deliberate before sending a reply; and as soon
as the British boat put off, orders were given to
clear the ship for action and get the people to
quarters, and Commodore Barron himself went
on deck. While this was being done, the
Leopard hailed, and fired a gun toward the
Chesapeake, followed by a whole broadside, and
for about twelve minutes she poured her fire
into the helpless Chesapeake. Commodore Barron,
a marine officer, and sixteen men were
wounded, and three men were killed. Commodore
Barron repeatedly ordered a shot to be fired
before the ensign was lowered, but there were
no means at hand for igniting the powder. At
last a young lieutenant named Allen ran to the
galley, and, taking a live coal in his fingers,
rushed back to the gun-deck and succeeded in
firing one of the guns in his division. At that
moment the American ensign touched the
taffrail.</p>

<p>The Leopard then sent a boat and took possession
of the three alleged deserters, and made
off, while the disgraced Chesapeake returned
to Norfolk.</p>

<p>It is not easy to describe the outburst of
indignation which followed this mortifying
event. Commodore Barron was court-martialled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>but as it was proved that his mistake
was one of judgment, and that he conducted
himself well after the danger became imminent,
he was merely sentenced to five years' suspension
from the navy.</p>

<p>The British government disavowed the action
of Captain Humphries of the Leopard, although
it did not punish him; but Vice-Admiral Berkley
was never again employed in the British navy. It
also restored the three men it had taken from the
Chesapeake to the deck of the American frigate.</p>

<p>After this affair it began to be plain that the
United States must either boldly repulse the
efforts of Great Britain in her claims to right of
search, or else tamely submit. The latter was
not to be thought of. The war of 1812 was
fought for the principle of protecting sailors in
American ships, and for the right to carry goods
in free bottoms; hence its motto was: "Free
trade and sailors' rights."</p>

<p>These were agitating times for the navy, as
officers of intelligence realized that war was
coming and it would be chiefly a naval war; and
they therefore strove diligently to perfect themselves
in their profession, so that when they
came in conflict with the seasoned sailors of
England the American navy might give a good
account of itself.</p>

<p>Lawrence was among the most earnest and
ambitious of these young officers, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>acquitted himself so well in those intervening
years that it was plain he would do well in
whatever situation he was placed.</p>

<p>In 1808 he was made first lieutenant of the
Constitution, and that was the last subordinate
place he held. In 1809 he got the Vixen, which
he exchanged for the Wasp, and finally the
Argus. In 1811 he got the Hornet, a fast and
beautiful little cruiser, carrying eighteen guns,
and was in command of her when the long-expected
declaration of war came in 1812.</p>

<p>The Hornet and the Essex, under Captain
Porter, were ordered to cruise with Captain
Bainbridge in the Constitution. But after getting
out from Boston in October, 1812, and cruising
a few weeks with the Constitution, they
separated. The Hornet, being off San Salvador,
challenged the Bonne Citoyenne, a vessel
of about her own strength, to come out and fight.
As the Bonne Citoyenne had a large amount of
specie on board which her captain was under
orders to deliver, he very properly declined to
fight, and was blockaded by the Hornet for
nearly three weeks. The Montagu, ship of the
line, appearing however, Captain Lawrence
thought it time to be off, and managed to slip
out to sea in the darkness of an autumn night.
He cruised some time, taking a few prizes,
and on the 24th of February came in sight of
a large man-of-war brig, the Peacock. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>called "the yacht" from the beautiful brightness
and order in which she was kept, and
was commanded by Captain Peake, a gallant
and skilful officer. The Peacock showed a perfect
willingness to fight, and the two vessels
stood for each other at once. About five
o'clock, being very near each other, their ensigns
were hoisted, and the battle began by
exchanging broadsides as they passed. After
one or two rounds the Hornet came down, her
batteries a sheet of flame, and her fire frightfully
destructive to her adversary. The Peacock
stood the blast of fire a very short time,
fifteen minutes being the longest time estimated,&mdash;Lawrence
afterward said it was eleven
minutes by his watch, but, his clerk having put
it down fifteen minutes, he allowed it to stand,&mdash;when
the Peacock lowered her colors and
displayed signals of distress in her forerigging.
She was in a sinking condition, when a prize
crew was thrown aboard; and in spite of every
effort on the part of the officers and men of
the Hornet, the Peacock went down, carrying
nine of her own people and three of the
Hornet's. The prize-master of the Hornet and
his boat's crew saved themselves with difficulty
in the launch.</p>

<p>The Peacock was well handled and fought by
her commander, who lost his life in the engagement.
But the Hornet was so skilfully man&oelig;uvred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>and her gunnery, besides being extremely
accurate, was so rapid, that she had the advantage
from a few minutes after the beginning of
the combat. She was slightly superior to the
Peacock both in men and metal, but the damage
she did was far beyond the small difference of
strength between her and her antagonist. When
the Peacock surrendered, her mainmast had gone
by the board, her hull was riddled, and she had
six feet of water in her, which soon carried her
to the bottom; while, by nine o'clock that night,
every injury to the Hornet had been repaired,
and she was ready to go into action again.</p>

<p>Lawrence treated his prisoners with characteristic
generosity, and his example was not lost
on his men. The Peacock's crew had lost
everything by the sinking of the ship, and the
Hornet's men took up a subscription among
themselves to provide each of the prisoners with
two shirts, a blue jacket, and trousers.</p>

<p>Finding himself crowded with prisoners,
Lawrence stood for home, and arrived at New
York late in March, 1813. The officers of the
Peacock, on being paroled at New York, addressed
him a very handsome letter of thanks,
in which they said, "We cannot better express
our feelings than by saying that we ceased to
consider ourselves prisoners."</p>

<p>The city of New York, anticipating the
thanks of Congress, and the gold medal for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>Lawrence, with prize money for the crew, gave
Lawrence the freedom of the city and a handsome
piece of plate. On the 6th of April a
great dinner was given at Washington Hall,
then a splendid place of entertainment in New
York, to Lawrence and his officers, while in the
ball-room of the building the petty officers,
sailors, and marines of the Hornet were entertained.
The sailors landed at Whitehall, and
with music playing, marched up Pearl Street,
Wall Street, and Broadway to Washington Hall
amidst the greatest enthusiasm on the part of
the inhabitants. After a fine dinner Captain
Lawrence and his officers, accompanied by the
members of the city government of New York,
visited them, and the party was received by the
sailors rising and giving three times three for
their commander. The whole body of sailors
was afterward invited to occupy the pit at the
theatre, with Lawrence and his officers and their
hosts in the boxes. The audience cheered the
sailors vociferously, and the sailors seem to
have cheered everything; and they were highly
pleased with their entertainment.</p>

<p>This was the last glimpse of brightness in
Lawrence's short life. He had a prospect of
getting the Constitution, but his hopes were
dashed by being ordered to command the Chesapeake,
then fitting at Boston.</p>

<p>The ship had become more and more an object
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>of dislike in the navy since her unfortunate
experience in 1807. Sailors hated her, and
would not enlist in her if they could help it.
No officer would serve in her if he could get
any other ship; consequently she was officered
by juniors who had to take her because they
could do no better. She had lately returned
from a cruise in which she had sailed many
thousands of miles, under an active and enterprising
captain, without once meeting a chance
to distinguish herself, and capturing only a few
trifling prizes. Lawrence was dismayed at the
offer of this command. He begged to remain
in the Hornet rather than go to the Chesapeake.
He told his friends that the frigate
was a worthless ship, and he would not have
her if he could honorably refuse; but this he
could not do. In May, 1813, he took command
of her. Up to the last moment he hoped to be
relieved by Captain Stewart, but it was not
to be.</p>

<p>He found the ship short of officers, and those
he had very young. His first lieutenant, Augustus
Ludlow, was a brilliant young officer, but
twenty-one years of age, who had never served
before as first lieutenant in a frigate. His
other sea lieutenants were midshipmen acting
as lieutenants. His crew was largely made
up of foreigners; and one, a Portuguese boatswain's
mate, was doing what he could to spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>dissatisfaction among the men because they had
not been paid the small amount of prize money
due from the last cruise. The marine guard
was made up wholly of Americans, and there
were a few men from the Constitution. These
men afterward gave a good account of themselves.</p>

<p>Outside the harbor of Boston it was known
that the Shannon, a fine thirty-eight-gun frigate,
lay in wait for the Chesapeake. Her commander,
Captain Philip Broke, was one of the best officers
in the British navy, and had had the ship
seven years. He had not followed the example
of so many British captains who neglected gunnery
practice with their crews, and paid dearly
for their rashness with their ships and sometimes
with their lives. Captain Broke was a
chivalrous man, and, desiring to engage the
Chesapeake on equal terms, wrote Captain Lawrence
a letter, proposing a meeting any time
within two months in any latitude and longitude
he might choose. Unfortunately, this letter
never reached Lawrence. On the first day
of June, 1813, the Shannon stood in toward
President's Roads, expecting an answer from
Lawrence to Captain Broke's challenge. Lawrence,
however, took the Shannon's appearance
as a challenge, and, lifting his anchor,
made sail to meet her.</p>

<p>At soon as the anchor was up, Lawrence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>had a flag hoisted with the inscription "Free
trade and sailors' rights." He then made a
short address to his men, which was coldly
received, not a cheer being raised at the prospect
of meeting the enemy.</p>

<p>The ship was cleared for action, and as she
passed out, the Shannon was waiting for her on
an easy bowline. Both ships proceeded under
a good breeze until about thirty miles beyond
Boston Light. They then came together under
short fighting canvas, and in the man&oelig;uvring
for a few moments Lawrence was in position to
rake his enemy; but whether it escaped him, or
he preferred to fight it out alongside, is not
known.</p>

<p>A few minutes before six, the ships being
fairly alongside, and not more than fifty yards
apart, the Shannon fired her first broadside, and
was immediately answered by the Chesapeake.
The effect of these first broadsides in smooth
water and close range was terrific. Three men
at the Chesapeake's wheel were shot down one
after another. Within six minutes her sails
were so shot to pieces that she came up into
the wind and was raked repeatedly. In a short
while Captain Lawrence was shot in the leg,
but kept the deck. Mr. White, the sailing-master,
was killed, and Mr. Ludlow, the first
lieutenant, Lieutenant Ballard, Mr. Brown, the
marine officer, and the boatswain were all mortally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>wounded. The Shannon had not escaped
scatheless, although the execution aboard of her
was not to be mentioned with the Chesapeake's.
Some of the British frigate's spars and sails
being shot away, she fell aboard her antagonist,
and the two ships were prevented from drifting
apart by the fluke of an anchor on the Shannon
hooking in the Chesapeake's rigging. Captain
Broke immediately ordered the ships lashed together.
This was done by the Shannon's boatswain,
who had his arm literally hacked off in
doing it, but who did not flinch from his
task.</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Lawrence saw the ships
were fast, he ordered the boarders called away.
But instead of this being done by the boatswain,
the bugler, a negro, was called upon to sound his
bugle. The man, in a paroxysm of terror, had
hid under a boat, and when found was perfectly
unable to sound a note. The remaining officers
on the Chesapeake's deck shouted for the
boarders, and at this moment the gallant
Lawrence, conspicuous from his commanding
figure, and wearing his full uniform, fell, shot
through the body. As he was being carried
below, he uttered those words which are a part
of the heritage of the American navy, "Don't
give up the ship."</p>

<p>The carnage on the Chesapeake's deck was
now frightful, and the men began to flinch from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>their guns. Captain Broke, seeing this, gave
the order to board, and, himself leading the
boarders with great intrepidity, sprang upon
the Chesapeake's quarterdeck. At this the Portuguese
mate and some other mercenaries threw
the berth-deck gratings overboard, and ran below,
crying, "So much for not paying men prize
money!"</p>

<p>A young lieutenant, coming up from the gun-deck,
was seized with a panic, and, throwing his
pistol down, ran below in a cowardly manner.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
But there were still gallant souls left upon the
unfortunate frigate's deck. Mr. Livermore, the
chaplain,&mdash;the only officer on deck when the British
entered the ship,&mdash;advanced boldly, firing his
pistol at Captain Broke, and made a brave defence,
although his arm was nearly cut from his body by
Broke in defending himself. The few marines who
were left fought desperately, and severely wounded
Captain Broke. All of these men were Americans,
and were cut down to a man. The officers
of the gun-deck tried to rally the men below, and
succeeded in inducing the few Americans to
follow them above; the brave Ludlow, in fearful
agony from his wounds, struggled up the hatchway.
But it was too late, and they were soon overpowered.
The flag had been hauled down by the
triumphant enemy; the ship was theirs. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>battle lasted only about fifteen minutes, and
seldom in the history of naval warfare has there
been more dreadful slaughter. The Chesapeake
suffered most, her captain and three lieutenants,
her marine officer, her sailing-master, boatswain,
and three midshipmen being killed, and her few remaining
officers wounded. She lost, besides, one
hundred and thirty-six men killed and wounded.
The Shannon had her captain badly wounded,
and lost several officers, and had seventy-five men
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The English ensign was immediately hoisted
over the American, and as soon as possible sail
was made for Halifax. Lawrence and his wounded
officers lay together in the ward room of the Chesapeake,
the cabin having been much shattered. For
four days Lawrence lingered in extreme anguish.
He bore his sufferings with silent heroism, and it
is remarkable that he never spoke except to make
known the few wants that his situation required.
On the Shannon Captain Broke lay, raving with
delirium from his wounds, and only occasionally
rational. At these times he would ask anxiously
after Lawrence, muttering, "He brought his ship
into action in gallant style," and other words of
generous admiration. When it was known that
Lawrence was no more, it was thought best to
keep it from Broke, as it was known it would
distress him greatly.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 6th of June, the two ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>entered Halifax harbor, the body of Lawrence
wrapped in the battle flag of the Chesapeake, and
lying on her quarterdeck. The people took the
Chesapeake for the President, and shouting multitudes
lined the shores and docks. But when it
was known that it was Lawrence's ship, and her
brave commander lay dead upon her, an instant
silence fell upon the people. They remembered
Lawrence's kindness to the officers and men of
the Peacock, and they paid him the tribute of
silent respect.</p>

<p>The funeral was arranged for the 8th of June,
and was one of the most affecting ever witnessed.
The British naval and military authorities
omitted nothing that could show their esteem
for a brave and unfortunate enemy. The garrison
and the fleet turned out their whole force,
the officers wearing crape upon the left arm.
The coffin, wrapped in the Chesapeake's flag,
with the dead officer's sword upon it, was brought
ashore in an admiral's barge, the men rowing
minute strokes, and amid the solemn booming of
minute guns. It was followed by a long procession
of man-of-war boats. It was landed at
King's Wharf, where six of the oldest British
captains acted as pall-bearers. The procession
to the churchyard of St. Paul's was very long.
The American officers were chief mourners, followed
by the officers of the Shannon; and the
presence of the wounded among both the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>and English officers was touching in the
extreme. Admiral Sir Thomas Saumerez, one
of Nelson's captains, and the officers of the fleet,
and the general of the forces, with the officers of
the garrison, came next in the procession, followed
by a large number of the most respectable
citizens of Halifax. The route was lined with
troops, and the funeral was like that of a great
and distinguished British admiral,&mdash;so great is
the respect all generous minds must feel for a
character like Lawrence's.</p>

<p>His young first lieutenant, Ludlow, survived
several days after landing; but he, too, soon followed
his captain to a hero's grave. Great honors
were also paid him at his interment.</p>

<p>The Americans, however, could not allow the
British to pay all the honors to the dead Lawrence,
and in August his remains and those of
his faithful lieutenant were transferred to Salem,
in Massachusetts, where they were temporarily
buried until they could be transferred to New
York. Lawrence's pall was carried then by six
American captains, among whom were Hull,
Stewart, and Bainbridge,&mdash;all men who had
known Lawrence, and served with him when he
was a dashing and brilliant young midshipman.
Eventually, both Lawrence and Ludlow were
buried in Trinity churchyard, New York, where
they still rest. Lawrence left a young wife and
two children, for whom the country provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>A poignant regret for Lawrence's misfortunes
and death was felt by the country generally.
His youth,&mdash;he was but thirty-one years of age,&mdash;his
brilliant career, the charming generosity
of his nature, and the graces of his person and
manner made him beloved and admired. His
fault&mdash;if fault it was&mdash;in seeking an action
when his ship was new to him and ill manned
and scantily officered, was that of a high and
daring spirit, and was readily condoned; while
to this day the story of the Chesapeake is painful
to a true American.</p>

<p>At the battle of Lake Erie Perry's flagship
bore the name of Lawrence; but, like Lawrence
himself, was unfortunate, and, after being cut to
pieces, was forced to strike. Another vessel was
named the Lawrence; but ships whose names
are associated with harrowing events are not
favorites with either officers or men, and she
was borne upon the navy list for only a few years.
But the name and fame of Lawrence will last
with his countrymen as long as the American flag
flies over a ship of war, and the pity of his fate
will ever be among the most moving incidents in
American history.</p>
